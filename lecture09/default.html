<h4>
Exit System Call
</h4>
</a>
A process can terminate itself by calling the <i>exit</i> system call.
The parameter for the call is an integer (called the exit status).  The
exit status of a process can be found out by its parent process (see
<i>wait</i> call below.  By convention, an exit status of 0 means
successful termination while a non-zero exit status means termination
because of some error.
<p>
When a process calls the exit system call, most resources held by the
process are released.  For example, all areas of physical memory allocated 
to the process are freed, its address translation tables are deallocated,
all open files are closed etc.  Only a minimal information about the process,
such as its exit status, resource usage information etc., is retained
in its process control block till the parent of this process collects
this information.  Finally the process enters the <i>Zombie</i> state
and calls the scheduler to give up the CPU to some other process.
<p>
A process may also terminate due to the receipt of a signal.  We shall
look at signals in more detail in a later lecture.

<h4>
Wait system call
</h4>
The <i>wait</i> system call is used by a parent process to wait for the
termination of a (any) child process.  The calling process returns with
an error if it has no child processes, immediately if it has some child
process that is already in the zombie state, and blocks (till a child
process terminates) otherwise.  The argument to the wait call is a pointer
to an integer variable that will be set (by the kernel) with a status word
that gives information
about the terminated child process.  The return value is the pid of this
``collected'' child process.
<p>
The status word returned by the wait call encodes information about how
the child terminated (exit call or signal receipt) and exit status or the
signal that caused termination.  The following macros can be used for
decoding this information.  See the manual pages for more information.
<ul>
<li>
<tt>WIFEXITED(status)</tt> - returns true if the child process used the exit 
call to terminate.
<li>
<tt>WEXITSTATUS(status)</tt> - returns the exit status of the child (if it
exited).
</ul>
Once information about a zombie process has been collected by its parent
in this manner, all retained information about the process is discarded 
by the kernel.
<p>
There are some more system calls like wait3, wait4 etc., that allow a process
to wait for a specified child process etc.  See the manual pages for details.

<h4>
Unix Process Hierarchy
</h4>
<center>

<p>
In Unix, at boot time, after performing initialization, the kernel
``handcrafts'' a process and execute the <i>init</i> program in this
process.  This process is the only one that is not created using the
fork call and has no parent.  The init program creates a <i>getty</i> process
(i.e., forks and execs the getty program in the child process) for each
terminal on the system.  The getty program prints a login prompt and waits
for a login name to be typed.  When the user types a login name, the getty
process execs the login program which reads the password, authenticate it,
and if the authentication is successful, it execs the login shell of the
user.  Note that the process running the login shell is a child of the
init process.  When this process exits, init (which was waiting for this
to happen) creates another getty process for the terminal.
<p>
Also, the kernel makes the init process the parent of any process whose parent
terminates.  Since the init program keeps waiting for its child processes to
die, no process can remain zombie for ever.

<h4>
Inter-Process Communication
</h4>
An application, at runtime, may create several processes that ``cooperate''
to perform the application functionality.  These processes may be running
the same program or different programs (all part of the overall application)
depending on the application requirement.  Such an architecture may be
used by the application developer for modularity or for concurrency.
For example, the C compiler typically uses several processes to achieve
the final translation of a C program into an executable binary.  Each of
these processes handles a different phase of compilation, such as 
preprocessing, translation from C to assembly, assembling, linking etc.
Splitting the entire compiler application into multiple processes in this
manner gives a lot of modularity and flexibility to the application.
As another example, an HTTP server may create several processes to handle
multiple HTTP requests concurrently.  In this case, all these processes
would be running the same program but working with different data.
Note that concurrency is possible even on a uniprocessor machine because
I/O and computation can proceed in parallel.
<p>
Such an application that consists of several processes that need to 
cooperate with each other needs, in general, facilities for:
communication (data sharing), and synchronization (coordination of activities) 
among the constituent processes.  Operating systems typically provide
several primitives for such inter-process communication.

<h4>
IPC Mechanisms
</h4>
There are two main categories of IPC mechanisms: message passing based
communication, and shared memory based mechanisms.
<p>
In message passing, as the name suggests, the processes can send arbitrary
messages to each other.  Note that message passing typically achieves goals
of both communication and synchronization simultaneously, since the receipt
of a message indicates something about the state of the sender.
<p>
In shared memory communication, two or more processes share some part
of their virtual address spaces.  That is, the same area of physical memory
is mapped to the address spaces of each of the processes (at the same or
different virtual addresses).  Thus communication is natural here, since
if a process modifies a shared memory location, the change is visible to
all other processes that share this memory location.  However, with shared
memory, we require additional synchronization primitives to ensure that
inconsistencies do not arise due, for example, to multiple processes attempting
to write different values to the same memory location at about the same
time.  We shall look at these synchronization issues later in the course 
when we discuss threads.
<p>
Originally, shared memory among processes was first implemented in the
System V flavour of Unix.  But now, it is available in most Unix flavours
including Linux.  The system call for setting up shared memory in such
systems is the <i>shmget</i> system call.  See the manual page for more
details.
<p>
It is also possible to implement higher level abstract ways of IPC
by building upon message passing.  Remote Procedure Calls and 
Remote Object Calls (e.g. RMI in Java) are examples of these.

<h4>Message Passing</h4>
Message passing has the following requirements: a way to establish a link
between the communicating processes, and primitives for sending and receiving
messages.
<p>
The link establishment may be implicit or explicit.
In direct communication, there is no explicit link establishment, and the
sender directly names the target process (using pid etc.) in the send call.
This method is clearly somewhat inflexible, and is not commonly used.
In indirect communication, a link is first explicitly established.  The link
may be variously known as channel, mailbox, port, message queue etc.
Corresponding to the link, the kernel would allocate a buffer that would be
used to store messages that have been sent but not yet delivered to the
receiver.  Both the sender and receiver would specify the link rather than
the identity of the other process in send/receive calls.
<p>
For establishing the link in indirect communication, one of the processes
first creates the link (using some system call).  The question is how does
the other process obtain access to this link.  One possibility is to give
the link a name that is known to both processes.  The second process would
then simply request the OS for access to the link with the specified name.
Clearly this scheme requires a notion of read and write permissions to be
associated with links so that arbitrary processes cannot send messages to
or receive messages from the link.  Examples of such a scheme are
named pipes in Unix, and System V message queues (see manual page of
<i>msgget</i> system call for details).
<p>
The other possibility is that the two processes are related (for example
by a parent-child relationship).  In this case one of the processes
creates the link, and then creates the second process which inherits access
to the link.  We shall see a detailed example of this scheme when we
study the operation of Unix (unnamed) pipes in detail in the next lecture.
Note that since only ``related'' processes can communicate in this
scheme, there is no need for permissions to be associated with the link.
<p>
There are some other design issues in message passing based communication.
For example, are the send and receive calls blocking or non-blocking.
That is, does the send call block till the message is delivered to the
receiver?  Similarly does the receive call block till a message is available?
Typically the send calls do not block (i.e., they are asynchronous) unless
the buffer associated with the link is full, and the receive calls typically
block (i.e., they are synchronous) till some message is available.
Another issue is: whether message boundaries are preserved?  That is, does
the receiver receive a sequence of demarcated messages, or just a stream of
bytes.  The former is the case with message queues, while the latter is the
case in the case of Unix pipes (both named and unnamed).
