<h3>About this lecture</h3>
</h3>
In this lecture we will study the process of linking the object files into an 
executable, loading the program into memory and its execution. We will also 
study how static and dynamically linked libraries work.

<h3>
From source to execution
</h3>
Compilers and assemblers create object files containing the generated binary 
code and data for a source file.  The linker combines multiple object files 
into an executable file, and the loaders (typically part of the loading
happens in the kernel and part at the user level)
load the executable into memory. The following diagram illustrates the process 
of execution of a program. We will discuss the components
of this process in detail in this lecture.

<h3>
Standard formats for executable files
</h3>
The kernel requires the executable files to be in a certain recognizable 
format for execution.  Following are some formats of executable files commonly 
used.
<ul>
<li><B>COFF (Common Object File Format)</B> is an object file format that was 
introduced in Unix System V Release 3.  Nachos OS uses this format due to its 
simplicity.
<li><B>ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)</B> is the standard format used by 
most operating systems today. 
An ELF file begins with an ELF header, followed by some program headers, the
actual code and data sections of the executable, and some section headers at
the end as shown in the figure below.
 We will shortly discuss some details of these elements.
<p>

 <br>
 The ELF format
 </center>

	<B>File Header: </B>
		The file header contains the following information
		<ul>
		<li><i>type</i> of the object file 
		(relocatable, executable, shared, core), its target architecture, 
			and the version of ELF it is using.
		<li>No. of <i>program headers</i> and <i>section headers</i> and their
		location in file (offset).
		<li><i>Entry point:</i> Code address where execution should begin for 
		this program. This is a virtual address and not an offset.
		</ul>
	
	<p>

	<B>Program Header Table: </B>
		The program header table is an array of entries which describe actual 
		areas of file to be loaded in the memory to create an executable 
		process image. The size of an entry in the table and the number of 
		entries in the table are given in the ELF header.
		Each entry in the program header table contains the type, file offset, 
		virtual address, file size, memory image size, and alignment for a 
		loadable area of the program.
	<p>
	<B>Sections: </B>
		There are a number of types of sections described by entries in the 
		section header table.  Sections can hold  the following:
		<ul>
			<li>executable code
			<li>data
			<li>bss: uninitialized globals and static locals
			<li>rodata: read only initialized data
			<li>dynamic linking information, symbol tables,	relocation information etc.
		</ul>
		Note that the loadable areas of the executable (as described by the
		program headers) are actually just some sections.  However, not all
		sections need to be loaded in the memory, for example, the debugging
		information (if present) is not loaded into memory.
	
	<p>
	<B>Section Header table: </B>The section header table contains a section
	header  for every section in the file.
	A section header provides the following information about the 
	corresponding section:
	<ul>
	<li>name
	<li>type of section (code/data/bss...)
	<li>size of section in bytes
	<li>virtual address(starting address of the memory image)
	<li>file offset
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Loading the file into memory
</h3>
<p>
The kernel does the following for loading the file into the memory
<ul>
	<li><i>Validity Checks: </i> The kernel checks that the file format, 
	architecture etc. for the file are valid.
	<li>looks at the program headers and determines the virtual address space
	layout for the process code and data.
	<li>creates address space and page tables for the process.
	<li>allocates stack pages for the program and initializes the stack.  The
	command line arguments and environment variable values are pushed at the
	bottom of the stack.
	<li>initializes saved register values for the process.  The saved PC value
	is initialized to the entry point address specified in the file header.
</ul>
<p>
An important question to consider in the process of loading is ``<i>how many 
pages of stack should be given to the process?</i>"
This question is difficult to answer since it depends on the program. 
Typically, therefore, the process starts out with just one or two pages of
stack and the stack is grown on demand.  When the process runs out of stack,
it generates a page fault.  The page fault handler determines that the fault
is because the program needs more stack space.  In this case, another page of
stack is given to the process. Generally, in the address space of the process,
there is an inaccessible hole between the data area and the stack area (see
figure below).  This allows the two areas to grow dynamically in different
directions.

<h3>
Object Files
</h3>
<p>
An object file is generated by the assembler after assembling an assembly
program.  The object file contains the generated machine code and data for a 
source file. The compilation of each source file results in an object file.
These object files are later linked together with the required libraries (by
the linker) to produce the executable file.
<p> 
Note that till the time linking is performed, the symbols in an object file
(function and global variable names) cannot be assigned addresses.  The
assignment of addresses is done later by the linker.  The format of the object
file is similar to that for an executable but contains extra information so
that linking can be performed.  The extra information is primarily a symbol
table which specifies the symbols imported and exported by the object file,
and a relocation table.  The relocation table is needed because absolute
references to symbols in the code and data need to be patched up their correct
values after the symbols have been assigned values.  This process is called
relocation and is discussed in the next section.

<h3>
The Linking Process
</h3>
<p>
The linker takes a set of object files as input.  It scans each file to
determine sizes of code and data sections etc., in each object.  The code and
data sections etc., from the various files are combined to create consolidated
code, data sections etc.  Now addresses can be assigned to all symbols since
the starting address of the code, and data etc., from each object file is 
known, and the symbol tables in the object files give the offset for each 
symbol defined in the file from this starting address.  Relocation is
performed next.
<h4>Relocation</h4>
The code and data in an object file typically contain references to symbols
defined in the same file and in other files.  Relocation is the process of
``patching up'' these references to contain the right addresses after
addresses have been assigned to all symbols.  The relocation table contains
the information necessary to carry out this process.  A relocation entry
specifies an offset (where the relocation is to be performed), a relocation
type, and the symbol name whose value should be used for reloction.  The
relocation type may specify that the symbol value should be plugged in at the
specified location, the symbol value should be added to the existing value at
the specified location etc.
<p>
Here is an example to understand relocation better.
<pre>
	// file1.c							// file2.c
	..								..	
	..								..
	g(); //call to function 'g'					void g(){
	..								..
	..								}
	..								..	
</pre>
In the source file <tt>file1.c</tt>, a call to function <tt>g</tt> is made,
and this function is defined in source file <tt>file2.c</tt>.  In the object
file for <tt>file1.c</tt>, the call instruction should carry the address of
the function <tt>g</tt> as the operand but this value is not known till
linking time.  Therefore, the object file <tt>file1.o</tt> will contain a
relocation entry specifying the place in the code where this relocation is to
occur, the type of relocation, and the symbol name <tt>g</tt>.  Once the
linker has assigned addresses to all symbols, it can perform this relocation.
<p>
Once relocation has been performed the linker outputs the final executable
file.

<h3>
Statically Linked Libraries
</h3>
<p>
A statically linked library (.lib files in Windows and .a files in Unix) is 
essentially a collection of object files, in a specific format.  During
linking, the libraries needed by the program are also specified to the linker.
From each specified library, the linker only links the necessary object files
with the program object files.
<p>
Most modern systems also support dynamically linked libraries.  There are many
advantages of using dynamically linked libraries, such as, saving is disk
space and memory, no need for relinking if the library changes etc.  The
linking process with dynamically linked libraries is, however, much more
complex and will be discussed in subsequent lectures.
