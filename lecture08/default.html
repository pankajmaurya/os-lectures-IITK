<h4>
Process Creation
</h4>
<p>
An existing process can create a new process through a system call provided by the OS.
Many operating systems (Unix in particular) have a notion of a parent-child
relationship among processes.
The creating process is called the parent process and the process it created 
is called the 
child process. The child may itself create new processes thus creating a tree 
like structure.

<a name= "mechanism"></a>
<h4>
Mechanisms to create a Process
</h4>
<p>
There are two main mechanisms to create a process: 
<ul>
<li>
The child process may simple execute another program from beginning.
An example of this is the <i>CreateProcess</i> system call of Windows.
The path to the file containing the program to be executed by the
child process is specified as an argument to the system call in this
case.
</li>
OR
<li>
The child process is the duplicate of the parent process.The address space and
register values are copied.  This approach is taken in Unix, and the system
call used to create a new process is the <i>fork</i> system call.  The fork
call takes no parameters.
</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<a name= "fork"></a>
<a href="#content"> Back to Contents</a>
<h4>
The fork() system call
</h4>
<p>
When a process calls the fork system call, the kernel creates a child
process of the parent process.  The address space of the child process,
its saved register values, its set of open files etc., are all duplicates of
the corresponding values of the creating (parent) process.  Since the
saved program counter value is also copied, the child process also
appears to return from the fork system call and starts executing the
same program as the one being executed by the parent process from this
state.  Thus at this point in time, both the parent and child are 
executing the same program and are in identical state.  There is only
one difference in the state of the two processes - the return value of
the fork call is different in the two processes.  In the parent process,
fork returns the process id (pid) of the child process, and in the child
process it returns 0.  This allows the program to take different execution
paths in the parent and child processes.  Fork returns -1 if the child
process could not be created for some reason (lack of resources, for example).

<p> Thus the typical usage of the fork call would look as below.
<pre>
	switch(cpid = fork())
	{
		case -1 :	/* ERROR */
		
		case 0  :	/* Child process */
				.....

		default :	/* Parent process */
				......
	}
</pre>

<h4>
The execve() system call
</h4>
Since the fork system call always makes the new process execute the same
program as the one being executed by the parent, we need a mechanism in
Unix to execute a new program in a process.  Unix provides the <i>execve</i>
system call for this purpose.  The arguments for this call are:
the path to the program file, command line arguments, and environment
variable values.  Please see the man page of execve for more details.
<p>
On calling execve, (if the call succeeds) the existing virtual address
space of the process is discarded, and the process is given a new address
space initialized as per the new program to be executed (i.e., it will 
contain code and initial data values specified in the executable file.
If successful, therefore, the execve call does not return.  The process
instead starts executing the new program from its initial state.
<p>
The standard C library actually contains many different wrapper functions
for the execve system call, such as <i>execl</i>, <i>execle</i>, 
<i>execvp</i> etc.  All these functions execute the same underlying
system call (execve) but accept arguments in different formats so that
the programmer can use the one most convenient to him.
<p>
In practice, a call is fork is almost always immediately followed
by a call to execve in the child process.  For example, to execute
the command ``ls'', the shell would use fork to create a child process,
and execute the program /bin/ls in the child process using execve.

<a name="comparison">
<h4>
Comparison of the two process creation models
</h4>
The glaring disadvantage of the fork/exec model for process creation
as compared to the model where a single call is used for both purposes
appears to be that in fork, the parent process' address space is copied
to the child process only to be immediately discarded during execve.
However optimizations to the naive fork implementation can reduce
this overhead substantially.
<p>
The main advantage of the fork/exec model is that before handing over
control to the new program (in the newly created process), the original
program (the one being executed by the parent process) has a chance
to manipulate the child process.  This is because the child process
is executing the same program till it calls execve.  This flexibility
is very commonly used, for example, for implementing I/O redirection
in Unix.  We shall see how this is done in a later lecture.
<p>
Another advantage of the fork/exec model is that in some cases the programmer
may want the two processes to actually execute the same program.
This may be needed, for example, for implementing concurrent
network servers.  This can of course be implemented using the single
call approach as well but with the fork/exec model, the new process
starts with a state that is a copy of the parent process state at the
time it called fork.  This means that the parent process can easily
pass some information about the work to be done to the child process.

<h4>
Copy on Write
</h4>
<p>
To avoid unnecessary duplication, typical fork implementations use
a mechanism called <i>Copy on write</i>
or <i> lazy copying</i>.

<p>Here the idea is that at the time of fork, the address space of
the parent is not physically copied to the child address space.
Instead, the parent and child are made to share the same physical
areas.  That is, the address translation tables for the child are
simply duplicated from those of the parent.  However all writeable
areas of the address space are marked read-only for both child
and parent processes.  Now, as long as neither of the two processes
writes any memory location (before one the processes has either
exited or called execve), no copying is needed.  As soon as one
of the processes tries to write to some memory location, an exception
is generated (since all areas of memory are marked read-only).
The exception handler recognizes that the exception has occurred
due to marking of the memory area read-only in order to implement
copy on write.  In this case, the exception handler makes a copy
of the area being written to, and maps this new copy to the relevant
part of the address space of the process that caused the exception.
Also this part of the address space is now marked writeable again
(in both processes) since the two processes no longer share the same
copy of this area.
<p>
The result is that only that part of the address space needs to be
copied that is actually modified by one of the two processes before
one of the processes either exists or calls execve.

<a name= "vfork"></a>
<h4>
The Vfork System Call
</h4>
Some flavours of Unix (e.g., Solaris) provide a separate process
creation system call <i>vfork</i>.  The semantics of vfork are that
the child and parent process actually run in the same address space
(i.e., they share memory) till the child either exits or calls execve.
This completely avoids the overhead of copying, and is, in general,
more efficient than the fork call.  However the programmer needs to
be aware that any changes made by the child process to some variable
would be visible in the parent process as well.
<p>
Since the parent and child run in the same address space in this case,
some mechanism is needed to ensure synchronization, so that, for example,
they do not attempt to modify the same variable at about the same time
leading to unpredictable results.  To ensure this, the parent process
is suspended till the child process either exits or calls execve.
<p>
<b>Note</b>: Linux also has a vfork call but its functionality is identical
to that of fork.
