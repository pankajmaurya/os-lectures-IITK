<h4>
Implementation of events
</h4>
<p>
In the previous lecture, we saw why we need a notion of `events': to make
processes sleep till a certain condition is satisfied, or till a certain 
event occurs.  In particular, we saw how semaphores could be realized
(in a non-preemptible kernel) using events.  Using events, in that case,
not only made the semaphore implementation correct, but also avoided
busy waiting.  We will later see that the notion of events is commonly
used also as a high level synchronization primitive (called a <i>condition
variable</i>).
<p>
The two basic operations on an event are: <i>sleep</i> (wait for the
event to occur), and <i>wakeup</i> (signal the occurrence of the
event, i.e., wakeup a process waiting for the event to occur),
There may also be a <i>wakeall</i> operation that wakes up <i>all</i>
processes waiting on the event.
<p>
In the previous lecture, we used an event as an abstract type.
But how can this type (and the operations on it) be implemented?
Essentially, for an event we need to store the list of processes
that are waiting for the event to occur.  Note that what actual
hardware or software event, the event represents is not important
in the implementation.  This list of processes is usually 
maintained as a FIFO queue.  The <i>sleep</i> and <i>wakeup</i>
operations manipulate this list to add and remove processes from
this list respectively.  For this reason, events are also often
called ``wait queues'' (for example, in the Linux kernel).
Note that events are often signaled
from interrupt handlers (for example, an interrupt handler may
signal the completion of an I/O operation).  Therefore, the
list of sleeping processes associated with an event is a critical
data structure which must be accessed mutually exclusively.
In a non-preemptible kernel, as we know already, this implies
that interrupts must be disabled while accessing or modifying
this list.  Here is a possible implementation of the <i>sleep</i>
and <i>wakeup</i> operations for a uni-processor with a non-preemptible
kernel.
<pre>
sleep(event e) {
    disable interrupts.
    add <i>current</i> process to wait queue of e.
    set state of current process to <i>Sleeping</i>.
    call schedule() to schedule another process.
    restore interrupt level.
}

wakeup(event e) {
    disable interrupts.
    remove a process p from the wait queue of e (if one exists).
    if a process p was found in the previous step, set its
        state to <i>Runnable</i> and add it to the ready queue.
    restore interrupt level.
}
</pre>

Several points about the above algorithms are noteworthy.  First note
that the <i>wakeup</i> operation does not call <tt>schedule</tt> to
immediately switch to the woken up process.  The woken up process is
simply made runnable (or ready to run), and will be scheduled by the
scheduler later in the normal course of things.
<p>
Note also that the <i>sleep</i> and <i>wakeup</i> operations, at the
end <i>restore</i> the interrupt level (to whatever it was when the
function was called) instead of simply reenabling interrupts.  This
is because the calling function may have already disabled interrupts
for some reason when this function was called, and on return from
this function, the calling function would expect the interrupts to
be still disabled.  Therefore, all functions that disable interrupts
would usually store the previous interrupt level in a local variable
while disabling interrupts, and at the end restore the interrupt
level to this saved value.  The kernel has functions which make this
task easy.  For example, the function to disable interrupts usually
returns the prior interrupt level, which can later be used as an
argument to the function used to restore an interrupt level.
<p>
Note also that we need to modify the ready queue in the <i>wakeup</i>
function.  Since the <i>wakeup</i> function can be called from
interrupt handlers, this implies that the ready queue itself must
be protected using interrupt disabling.  In particular, the
<i>schedule</i> function must disable interrupts while accessing
the ready queue.
<p>
Another important point about the <i>sleep</i> function above
is that calls the scheduler (function <i>schedule</i>) with
interrupts disabled.  Does that mean that interrupts will remain
disabled while the process is asleep.  Clearly, this is neither
desirable nor necessary.  The <i>schedule</i> function itself
(while disabling interrupts, as discussed above) would store the
current interrupt level in a local variable, and at the end
restore the interrupt level indicated by this variable.  Note
however, that the kernel stack changes during the context switch.
This means that the <i>schedule</i> function restores the
interrupt level when this (<i>schedule</i>) function was called
by the process that is now running (after the context switch).
When the process which has just been switched out is rescheduled,
its interrupt level just before calling the <i>schedule</i>
function will hence get restored.
<p>
In other words, the interrupt level of a process is also saved
at the time of context switch, and is later restored when this
process is scheduled again.
