<h4>Booting the Operating System:</h4>
Booting is the sequence of events which are responsible for loading the Operating System on a computer when 
it is started. Just after a computer has been turned on, it doesn't have an operating system in the memory. 
The hardware itself cannot perform complicated actions of the OS such as loading a program from the disk, 
disk I/O etc. Therefore there should be some mechanism to load the OS in the memory at the start. 

<P>
Loading the OS code in memory is a two step process.  First, at power on, a 
small bootloader program resident in the ROM starts executing.  This program
loads a more complex bootloader or bootstrap loader program (such as LILO
or Grub for Linux) from the disk.  This bootloader is generally stored in
the first sector (the so called boot sector) of the disk.
This bootloader does the important task of loading the OS into the memory.

After loading the Operating System, control passes to the <i>main</i> function of the OS. This function basically 
initializes the resources etc. Following are the main functions of the initialization code: 
<ol>
<li>To perform initializations - The OS performs the following initializations at this stage:  
<ul>
<li>Initializes data structures needed for various computations.
<li>Performs hardware level initializations. 
<li>Loads the interrupt vector table into the memory and enables interrupts.
<li>Sets up address translation tables needed to translate virtual address space to physical address space and ``turns on'' virtual memory.
</ul>
Note that at power on time, the processor is in the supervisor mode, all 
interrupts are disabled (since interrupt handlers have not been installed yet),
and virtual memory is turned off (since the address translation tables have
not been set up yet).

<li>To <i>create</i> the first user process - We know that the OS runs always in context of some process and is 
itself a passive entity. Therefore we always need at least one process for the system to function.
Usually processes are created by other processes by making system calls.
However, the first process is <i>hand-crafted</i> by the operating system.
This process is usually made to execute a trusted (by the operating system)
program.  This program is the <i>init</i> program in Unix.

After handcrafting the first process, the OS initialization code ``returns''
in the context of this process.  The effect is that this process starts 
executing the user program (e.g., <i>init</i>) in the user mode.  From now
on, the OS code only executes in response to a system call, interrupt, or
exception.
program which runs mainly to make the OS run the OS code in context of itself. It runs in the user mode.

<h4>Operating System vs Kernel</h4>
So far, our descriptions have assumed that the operating system code always
runs in the supervisor mode of the processor.  This need not be true, in general.
It is possible that some services expected from the operating system by the users
may be provided by user level processes.  In fact, the term Operating System
itself may have different connotations for different users.  A naive user might
believe the shell, and the windowing system to be actually part of the
operating system, while a low level programmer may be more savvy.
The term <i>kernel</i> is used to denote that part of the operating system code
that runs in the supervisor mode of the processor.  Thus, to be technically
precise, we should use the term kernel whenever we mean this part of the OS
code.

<P>
<h4>Monolithic v/s micro-kernels</h4>
Most commercial operating systems (most flavours of Unix, for example) implement
all OS services in the kernel itself.  Such kernels are called <i>monolithic</i>
kernels since such a kernel is a big, fat blob of code.  This approach has
the disadvantage that maintaining the kernel code is very difficult, since
any change in the code is likely to affect many other pieces of code.

<p>
An alternative to monolithic kernels is the model of so called <i>micro-kernels</i>.
A micro-kernel provides only basic functionality that <i>must</i> be implemented
in the kernel, and the rest of the OS services are provided by user level
server processes.  This design was motivated by the fact that not all OS code
<i>needs</i> to execute in the supervisor mode.
The entire OS now consists of the kernel, and several user level programs.
All these components are physically isolated from each other (i.e., they run
in different address spaces), and can only interact through well defined
interfaces.  This has the advantage of making the OS code much more maintainable
since changes to any one part of the code impact a smaller fraction of the
total code.

<p><i><a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html"
 target="new">Mach</a></i> is one of the best known examples of a micro-kernel.
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html" target="new"><i>GNU 
HURD</i></a> is a well known, Unix like operating system that is built on top
of the Mach kernel.

<P>
To understand the operation of a micro-kernel based operating system, consider
a hypothetical example.  In this example, the kernel provides only low level
services to access the disk device and does not implement the file system
abstraction.  Of course, this facility for low level disk I/O is only available
to ``privileged'' processes.  Assume now that a user level ``file server''
implements the file system abstraction.  Now consider a usual user level
application that needs to access some files.  Since the file system functionality
is provided by the file server and not by the kernel, how does the user
application get access to this service?  The usual answer is that the kernel
implements a message passing based inter-process communication (IPC) service.
Using this service, the application process can send file access requests to
the file server.  The file server uses kernel provided low level disk I/O
services to handle the request, and sends the result back as a message to the
application process.

<p>
Note that in this entire process, the application must make two system calls
to the kernel (one to send the request message, and the other to receive the
reply), the file server again needs to make two system calls to receive and
send the messages.  In addition, the file server may, in general, need to make
other system calls to the kernel to complete the request (to read some sector
of the disk, for example).  Thus a minimum of four, and possibly more system
calls are required for a single request.  Since the overhead of making a 
system call is substantial, this contributes to a significant performance
penalty.
<p>
In addition, before the application process can continue, there must be at
least two context switches - from the application process to the file server,
and vice versa.  As we will see soon, a contex switch also has a significant
performance penalty
<p>
Further, there is the overhead of copying messages from sending process'
address space to the kernel, and then from the kernel to the receiving process'
address space.
<p>
Thus, the performance of a micro-kernel based OS strongly depends on how 
efficiently IPC is implemented in the kernel.  Even though, micro-kernels
use heavily optimized IPC implementations, such operating systems still are at
a considerable performance disadvantage when compared to the traditional
monolithic kernels.  It is due to this reason primarily, that micro-kernel
architecture is not used very often by mainstream operating systems.
