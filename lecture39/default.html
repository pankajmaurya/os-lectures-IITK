<h4>
Introduction :
</h4>
In the last class we looked at few aspects of Device Drivers which are kernel 
level software modules that understands and implements the interface specific 
to the drive. We also saw some uses and functions of the device drivers. In this 
lecture we will study interrupt handling in device drivers and then disk scheduling.
<p>

<h4>
Interrupt Handling :
</h4>
The Device Driver for an interrupt driven device handles the interrupts from that 
device. The processing required depends upon the type of the device. The device 
driver for the device must clearly supply the function required to handle the interrupts 
from that device.

The firgure above tells what happens when an interrupt is received. The sequence of arrows 
show basic stages in interrupt handling.
<p>
There are two kinds of things to be done while handling interrupts:<br>
1.Things that must be immediately done: Things like acknowledging interrupts and performing 
hardware operations need to be done as soon as interrupts arrive. For eg. acknowledging a key 
press interrupt and reading the key code from the keyboard controller buffer. This needs to be 
done immediately because the device controller buffer is small and there may be more key presses. 
If this data is not soon copied into memory then chances are that we may loose some data.

<p>
2.Things that can be delayed: For eg. post processing or cooking of the data received from a 
terminal device. Anything that can be delayed must be delayed.
<p>
The first set of actions are done immediately as the interrupt arrives and hence it is called 
<i>"top half processing"</i>. The second set that can be delayed comes under <i>"bottom half 
processing"</i>. Although they are called <i>half</i>, they are not. Top half can be just 5% 
and bottom half 95%.
<p>
In any interrupt handling, first whatever top half processing needs to be done is done and 
the bottom half tasks are scheduled. Top half tells the kernel that these bottom half tasks 
need to be done. The tasks are added in a data structure which is a list of tasks. The 
added entry is basically some function pointer and its parameters. The kernel performs the 
bottom half tasks just before returning to the user mode. At this point there are no pending 
interrupts. This is the only stage when tasks could be done because they might need locks and may 
cause deadlocks.

<h4>
Disk Scheduling :
</h4>
Here we will study the disk-scheduling algorithms that schedule the order of disk I/Os to 
improve performance. The disk is the slowest storage device in a computer. To remove the 
vast difference in the speeds of memory and disk we do various sort of things at different 
levels. They are:
<p>
1.Caching
<p>
2.Layout data on the disk considering seek time and rotation time delays.
<p>
3.Disk-scheduling is the third level mechanism. To have a look at its importance consider 
two processes P which reads from a file f and Q which reads from a file g. If f and g are 
on cylinder group far away from each other then each time a process gets scheduled we will 
be wasting a lot of time as seek time delay.
<p>

Therefore, disk-scheduling turns out to be fairly important. We can inmprove both access time 
and the disk bandwith by scheduling the servicing of the disk I/O request in some order. It is 
basically a part of disk device driver.

<h4>
Optimal Solution:
</h4>
<p>
<img src="graph.JPG" width="512" height="384">
<p>
Let us consider that there is a list of pending disk requests. Now consider the graph G = (V,E) 
where V = cylinder group corresponding to all the pending disk requests and E = edge between 
each pair of vertices such that weight of the edge between vertices Ci and Cj ( note Ci and Cj are
cylinder groups) is proportional to the seek time taken by the head to move form Ci to Cj. Now finding 
the optimal solution is same as finding the lowest cost hamiltonian cycle starting from the initial 
vertice which is the initial position of the disk arm. But this problem is NP-hard problem. So we try to 
have approximate algorithms for the same.

<h4>
Disk Scheduling Algorithms:
</h4>
<b>First Come First Serve (FCFS) :</b> The one who asks for the service first gets served first. This 
is the simplest and the fairest of all the algorithms. This algorithm is free from any sort of 
starvation. Although everyone gets an equal chance, this algorithm does not provide the fastest 
service. We could have done better if we would have used the information about the current head position 
and about the sequence of the remaining requests.
<p>

<b>Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF):</b> Here we service the request which is closest to the current 
head position i.e. SSTF algorithm selects the request with the minimum seek time. This uses greedy 
algorithm and is not optimal. This algorithm is not fair as those requests that are near the center 
of the disk get undue advantage. This algorithm may cause starvation of some requests. For eg. consider 
a continual stream of requests arriving near one another. In this case a request far away may get starved.
This scenario becomes increasingly likely if the pending-request queue grows larger. Therefore we have 
good average service time but variance in the service time is huge.
<p>

<b>Elevator Algorithm :</b> Here the disk arm starts at one end of the disk, and moves towards the other 
end, servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder, until it gets to the other end of the disk. At the, 
other end, the direction of the head movement is reversed, and the servicing continues. The head 
continuously scans back and forth across the disk. This algorithm is also called as SCAN algorithm. It 
is a dumb algorithm because the arm travels from one end to the other end even if there is no request 
pending at the far end. This algorithm is also not the fairest algorithm. It is less efficient than the 
SSTF algorithm and has a lesser average service time but it has lesser variance in service time than SSTF. 
Therefore it is more fair than SSTF.
<p>

<b>LOOK Scheduling:</b> It is a variation of SCAN scheduling. Here arm goes as far as the final request 
in each direction. Then it reverses back immediately without going all the way to the end of the disk. This 
prevents the useless movement of the disk arm and hence increases the average service time.
<p>

<b>C-SCAN and C-LOOK scheduling:</b> Like in SCAN, in C-SCAN moves the head from one head to the other servicing 
the requests along the way with an exception. In this, request gets serviced in one direction only. No 
request is serviced in the reverse direction or on the return trip. This although decreases the overall 
average servicing time, it decreases the variance in service time and hence fairness increases significantly.
C-LOOK is essentially same as LOOK but with the same sort of modification.
