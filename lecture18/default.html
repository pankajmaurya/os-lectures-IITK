About the lecture
</h4>
In the previous lectures, we have seen how the synchronization problems
can be solved at the kernel level for uni-processor and multi-processor
systems.  As we know, user-level multi-threaded applications have similar
synchronization requirements.  These applications rely on kernel or thread
library provided facilities for achieving the desired synchronization.
<p>
We should note that in a user-level thread library (i.e., where threads
are implemented entirely at the user level), the synchronization issues
are similar as in kernels for uni-processors (since the library timeshares
a single virtual processor among multiple user-level threads).  Similar 
solutions can therefore be used.  For instance, the library code may be 
made ``non-preemptable''.   Signals handled by the library (for example,
the timer signal) are similar to interrupts at the kernel level and 
the ``interrupt disabling'' technique can be used to protect data structures 
also accessed by signal handlers.  Semaphores can be implemented in such
a library in a fashion similar to that for the kernel.
<p>
For a hybrid thread implementation, the thread library would use techniques
similar to those used in multi-processor kernels since here is library
is timesharing a number of virtual processors (kernel threads) among a 
larger number of user-level threads.
<p>
In this lecture, we focus attention on user-level programs.  We discuss
some high level synchronization constructs other than semaphores and see
how common synchronization problems can be solved using these constructs.

<h4>
Use of semaphores to solve the Producer-Consumer problem</h4>

<p>
We can easily solve the producer-consumer problem by using three
semaphores. A semaphore <i>mutex</i> is used for the purpose of providing 
mutual exclusion. Another semaphore <i>empty_slots</i> is used by
producers to reserve an empty slot in the buffer.   Similarly,
consumers use a semaphore <i>full_slots</i> to reserve a full slot
(for emptying) in the buffer.  Note that the number of full slots
(empty slots) in the buffer may be more than one at some point in
time.  In this case, the semaphore semantics will allow as many
producers (consumers) to reserve empty slots (full slots) as the
number of such slots available.  The semaphore <i>mutex</i> will
however ensure that the buffer is accessed mutually exclusively.
Note also that at any given point in time, the sum of the values
of the two semaphores <i>empty_slots</i> and <i>full_slots</i>
would always be equal to N - the total number of slots in the buffer.

<PRE>	
        // shared variables
        item queue[N];
	int in=0,out=0;
	semaphore mutex=1, empty_slots=N, full_slots=0;
	
Producer:
	while (true) {
		produce item i;
		P(empty_slots); // wait for an empty slot
		P(mutex);	// wait for mutual exclusion
		queue[in]=i;	in= (in+1)%N;
		V(mutex);
		V(full_slots);  // one more full slot available
	}

Consumer:
	while (true) {
		P(full_slots);	// wait for a full slot
		P(mutex);
		i=queue[out];	out= (out+1)%N;
		V(mutex);
		P(empty_slots);	// one more empty slot available
		consume item i;
	}

<h4>
Disadvantages of using semaphores</h4>
	
<p>
Although semaphores provide a convenient and effective mechanism for 
synchronization, their incorrect use can result in severe errors such
as a dead-lock state or violation of mutual exclusion. And this may happen 
even due to a mistake in a single process. The important thing is that these 
type of mistakes are very difficult to trace at the time of debugging because 
the errors happen only if when some particular execution sequence take place. 
Consider the following examples.
	
<PRE>		V(s)				P(s)		
		-----				-----
		critical section		critical section
		-----				-----
		P(s)				// programer omits the V(s) operation
		example (i)			example (ii)
</PRE>
In example (i), the P and V operations are interchanged. When this process 
enters its critical section instead of reducing the value of s by one it 
increases the value by one; therefore two more processes can enter into the 
critical section. Note that this error will manifest itself only if some other 
process enters in critical section when this process is executing in critical 
section.
	
<p>
In example (ii), the V(s) operation is omitted. Once this process enters into 
the critical section, all the other processes that want to enter the critical 
section will go into deadlock state.

<h4>
Critical Region Constructs</h4>
<p>
To overcome the errors due to incorrect use of semaphores by the programmers,
a number of high level language constructs have 
been introduced. One of them is the Critical Region construct. This construct 
requires that a variable v of type T, which is to be shared among many 
processes, be declared as 
<PRE>
    v: shared T;
</PRE>
and can be accessed only inside <i>region statements</i> as:

<PRE>
    region v when B do S;
</PRE>

This construct ensures that, while statement S is being executed, no other 
process can access the variable v. The expression B is a Boolean expression.
When a process tries to enter in the critical region, 
the Boolean expression B is evaluated; if it is false the process must wait 
until B becomes true. 
Such ``guard expressions'' can be used to model the conditions in 
synchronization problems. For example, in the Producer-Consumer problem we can 
check empty and full conditions using such expressions.
<p>
A solution to the producer-consumer problem using the conditional region
construct is left as an exercise.
<h4>
Monitors
</h4>

<p>
Another high level synchronization construct is the Monitor construct. 
A monitor encapsulates the data and the code of operations on the data, just
like an object in object-oriented programming. The data 
can be accessed only through the operations defined within the monitor. 
These operations are called the entry points for the data.
<PRE>
	Monitor X {
		data 
		operation f:
			code of operation f
		operation g:
			code of operation g
	}
</PRE>
<p>
The monitor construct ensures that only one process at a time can be 
active within the monitor. For example, while a process P1 is executing the 
operation f of the monitor shown above, another process P2 can not execute 
f or g. The programmer does not need to code this synchronization constraint 
explicitly. A monitor uses an entry lock for this purpose. Each process must 
acquire the entry lock before entering the operation code.
<p>
Monitors also provide the <i>condition variable</i> construct for allowing
processes to wait for events to occur (recall the events discussed earlier
in the context of kernel synchronization).  Any number of condition
variables can be declared within a monitor.  
The operations on the conditional variables are <i>Wait</i>, <i>Signal</i>,
 and <i>Broadcast</i>.  The <i>Wait</i> operation causes the calling process
to <i>atomically</i> give up the monitor lock and go to sleep in a queue
associated with the condition variable.  The atomicity here is required
to ensure that no wakeups are ``lost'', as before.  After waking up, the
process reacquires the entry lock of the monitor before returning from
<i>Wait</i>.  The <i>Signal</i>
operation wakes up one process waiting on the condition variable, while
the <i>Broadcast</i> operation wakes up all such processes.

<p>We illustrate the use of monitors using the producer-consumer problem. 
In the following solution, the buffer is encapsulated in a monitor with
operations for adding and removing items from the buffer.  Once the
monitor is defined, the producer and consumer processes only need to
repeatedly call the add and remove operations respectively.
<PRE>	
    Monitor bounded_buffer {
        int in=0, out=0, size=0;
        item queue[N];    // data of the monitor
        condition not_full, not_empty;    // condition variables
            
        void add(item i) {
            while(size==N)    
                wait(not_full);  // waits for signal operation on not_full
            queue[in]=i; in = (in+1)%N;
            size++;
            signal(not_empty);
        }
        
        item remove() {
            while(size==0)    
                wait(not_empty); // waits for signal operation on not_empty
            i= queue[out]; out = (out+1)%N;
            size--;
            signal(not_full);
            return i;
        }
    }
</PRE>
There is no need to explicitly code for mutual exclusion because it is ensured 
by the monitor construct. So the code is quite straight foreward. When size 
becomes N, the add operation invokes the wait operation on condition variable 
not_full. Note that the wait operation first releases the entry lock acquired 
by the add operation and sends the process executing this operation, say P, 
into sleep. When remove operation invokes the signal operation on 
not_full, the process P will be woken up and when it returns into add 
operation it will have the entry lock again.
