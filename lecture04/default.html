<h4>
Implementation of System Calls
</h4>
<p>
The interface between the operating system and the user programs is defined 
by the set of system calls that the operating system provides. Hence it is 
important for us to understand the implementation of the system calls in 
general, i.e., details of how the control
goes from a user level program to the kernel etc. 

<p>
To request a service from the operating system (i.e., to make a system call), 
a user program needs to execute the <i>trap</i> instruction.  As we have
seen earlier, this causes the CPU to save some critical registers, change
mode of execution to the supervisor mode, and jump to a trap handler routine
which is part of the operating system.  Since the
trap instruction (typically) does not have any operands, a mechanism is
needed to specify which system call is being invoked and what are the parameters
for the system call.

<p>The system call is identified using a <i>system call number</i>.
The operating system assigns a unique system call number to each distinct
system call that it supports.  In Linux, you can find the system call numbers
corresponding to various system calls by examining the header file:
<tt>/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</tt>.

<p>Before executing the trap instruction, the user program must place the
system call number in an ``agreed upon location'', typically either a register
or the stack.  Similarly, the arguments must be placed in agreed upon locations,
again either registers or the stack.  The trap handler in the operating system
code picks up the system call number and its arguments from these locations
and calls the appropriate function in the OS code (depending on the system
call number) to carry out the operation requested by the user program.  
Finally, the return value of executing the system call is placed by the
trap handler in an agreed upon location before executing the <i>return from
interrupt</i> instruction.  Then the user program regains control, and picks
up the return value from this location. These conventions, i.e., the system 
call number assignment, where the system call
number and arguments are placed, how the return value of the system call is
returned to the user program etc., constitute the <i>Application Binary
Interface</i> (ABI) of the operating system.

<p>Under Linux running on x86 processors, the conventions are: system call
number is placed in register EAX, the arguments in EBX, ECX etc., and the
return value is placed in register EAX again.

<p>In a C program, the system calls can be made as if they were ordinary
library functions.  How is this achieved?  Clearly, the compiler (for 
obvious reasons) does not have builtin knowledge about system calls 
supported by the Operating System.  Rather, corresponding to each system
call there is a library function in the C library, which places the
system call number, arguments etc., at the right place, executes the
trap instruction, and then returns the result (usually after some small
modifications) to the calling function.

<p>To understand the ABI better, write a simple Hello, world program in C,
compile and statically link it (using the -static option of gcc), then examine
the assembly code of the library function <tt>write</tt> using gdb.  Use
the command ``disass write'' at the gdb prompt for this.

<h4>
Execution Model of the Operating System
</h4>
<p>
An operating system is also (usually) a C program with the usual main function.
However, its execution model is very different from that of usual C programs.
A C program defines some computation to be performed.  In other words, it has
an `agenda' of its own, a predefined flow of control that determines how the
code will behave.  An operating system on the other hand is more like a library
of useful functions (we saw this analogy in a previous lecture) and has no
computation of its own to perform.  Once the initializations are over (this is
what the main function of the operating system does, more on it in the next
lecture), the OS code simply processes interrupts and system calls as they
occur.

<P>
Thus, the OS code should be seen as a passive rather than an active entity.
We have already seen informally
what the term process means (an instance of a program execution) though we
will revisit this notion soon.  When a process (running some user program
in the user mode of the processor) makes a system call, as we know, the
trap handler (which is part of the OS code) starts executing.  We say that
at this point, the OS code is executing <i>on behalf of</i> the process, or
equivalently, the process is <i>running inside the OS</i>, or that the OS
code is running <i>in the context of</i> the said process, rather than 
simply saying that the OS is running.  Note that if a user process is running,
and an interrupt occurs, the OS code handles the interrupt in the context
of the currently running process, even though the interrupt may not have
been caused by an action of this process.
