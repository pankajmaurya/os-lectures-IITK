<h4>Introduction </h4>
<p align="justify">In the last lecture, we discussed about  static linking, program loading and relocation. In this lecture, we will discuss about  dynamic linking - its need and  working. We will also study about position independent code.</p>

<h4>What is Dynamic Linking?</h4>
<p align="justify">In dynamic linking, the library code is not a part of the binary image of the program (unlike in static linking) but is rather linked at runtime. Dynamic linking thus defers the linking process until a program starts running. The program contains information about the libraries to be linked and the dynamic linker uses this information  to load and link the libraries at runtime. We will see how the whole mechanism works in a short while. </p>

<h4>Advantages and disadvantages of  dynamic linking</h4>
<p align="justify">There are many advantages that dynamic linking has over 
static linking. First, the binary files  are much smaller because no library 
code has to be linked with the program at the time of compilation. 
As an example, with static linking, this program 
<a href="files\hello.c">hello.c</a> generated an executable file of size 
2.08 MB on a Linux system, but with  dynamic linking, the executable generated 
was only 8.45 KB in size. Secondly, with dynamic linking, a program does not
have to be relinked to use a newer version of the library.
Thirdly, dynamic linking permits a program to load and unload routines at 
runtine, a facility that results in better management of the physical memory 
and can otherwise be very difficult to provide. Finally the code of dynamically
linked libraries in physical memory can be shared by all processes that are
running programs that use the library.  This can result in a huge saving in
memory requirements.
<p align="justify">However, there are a few disadvantages as well. Firstly, 
the runtime performance costs of dynamic linking are substantial compared to 
those of static linking, since a large part of the linking process has to be 
redone every time the program runs.
Another problem is that since dynamic shared libraries are so easy to update 
compared to static libraries, it is easy to change libraries that are in use 
by existing programs, which means that the behavior of these programs may change
even though ``nothing has changed''. Most programs ship with copies of all of 
the libraries they use, and installers often inadvertently install an older 
version of a shared library on top of a newer one, breaking programs that are 
expecting features found in the newer one. Well-behaved applications ideally 
pop up a warning before installing an older library over a newer one, but even 
so programs that depend on semantics of older libraries have been known to 
break when newer versions replace the older ones. </p>

<h4>How dynamic linking works?</h4>
<p align="justify">As is evident, there should be a program (dynamic linker) 
to dynamically load and link the dynamic libraries. The simplest way is to 
statically link this dynamic linker with the program although this is not done 
in practice. In UNIX, &quot;ld.so&quot; is the dynamic linker. The entry point 
of the program execution is the start function which passes control to the 
dynamic linker. The dynamic linker loads and links the required libraries and 
then calls the &quot;main&quot; function of the program to allow the program
to start its execution.</p>
<p align="justify">The <i>mmap</i> system call is used to dynamically 
load the code and data of a library into the address space of the process. 
The <i>mmap</i> system call maps a file or its part into the address space of 
the calling process. On calling <i>mmap</i>, the kernel finds some unused hole 
in the address space of the process and maps the specified file contents there.
The prototype for the <i>mmap</i> call is as follows.
<blockquote>
<code>
void * mmap(void *start, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset)
</code>
</blockquote>
The arguments are:
<dl>
<dt>
<code>fd</code> 
<dd>The file descriptor of the file (or other object) to be mapped.
<dt>
<code>start</code> 
<dd>The preferable address in the address space of the process where the file 
or its part should be mapped. This is usually specified as 0. Please note that 
this is just the preferable location and not the memory location where the 
file is actually mapped. The actual location in the memory where the file is 
mapped is in fact returned by mmap.
<dt><code>length</code> 
<dd>The number of bytes to be mapped.
<dt><code>prot</code> 
<dd>This arguement describes the desired memory protection and must not conflict
with the open mode of the file specified by the file descriptor. It has the
following bits.
            <ul>
              <li><code>PROT_EXEC</code> - Pages may be executed.</li>
                <li><code>PROT_READ</code> - Pages may be read.</li>
                <li><code>PROT_WRITE</code> - Pages may be written.</li>
                <li><code>PROT_NONE</code> - Pages may not be accessed.</li>
            </ul>
<dt><code>flags</code> 
<dd>It specifies the mapping type, mapping options and whether  modifications 
made to the mapped copy of the page are private to the process or are to be 
shared with other processes. It has the following bits.
            <ul>
              <li> <code>MAP_FIXED</code> - It indicates  not to select a 
			  different address than the one specified by <code>start</code>. 
			  If the specified address cannot be used, the call to mmap will 
			  fail. If this flag is specified, start must be a multiple of the 
			  pagesize. Use of this option is however discouraged.
              <li><code>MAP_SHARED</code> - Share this mapping with all other 
			  processes that map this object. Making changes in the region is 
			  equivalent to writing to the file.  So, changes made in the file 
			  will be visible to all the other processes using this file.
              <li><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> - Create a private copy-on-write 
			  mapping. Changes to the region do not affect the original file 
			  and are thus not visible to the other processes using this file.
            </ul>
            Exactly one of <code>MAP_SHARED</code> and <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> must be specified.
<dt><code>offset</code> 
<dd>The offset in the file starting at which the <code>length</code> number of 
bytes will be mapped to the address space.
</dl>
<code>mmap</code> returns the pointer to the mapped area on success. On error, 
-1 is returned.
<p align="justify">For more information on <code>mmap</code>, please refer 
to the man pages.</p>

<h4>Dynamic Relocation</h4>
<p align="justify">  When the library source code files are compiled, there 
are places  in the  code where relocations need to be done. Suppose, in some 
library (say libx.so),  some function f() calls a function g()  which, in 
general, may  be a part of either the same library or some other library. 
Now, the operant of the call instruction needs to be relocated by the linker 
at the time of linking. As we have already seen, if this library is statically 
linked with the program, these relocations can be done at the linking time 
because the linker knows  in advance where the library code and data will be 
loaded in the (virtual) address space of the process.  But it is easy to see 
that this is not the case with dynamic linking. Here the (static) linker 
does not know in advance the address at which the library code will be loaded. 
In fact, for different programs, the library code and data may get mapped at
different addresses.  So, in the library code, the relocations will have to be 
done at runtime by the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker will have to read 
the relocation tables in the library file (called the dynamic relocation 
tables) and do the relocations accordingly. This would require the  library 
code  to be writeable in memory and as a consequence, there will have to be as 
many copies of library code in the physical memory as are the number of 
processes using the library.  Thus the library code needs to be mapped with
the MAP_PRIVATE option.  We will see later that if the code in the library is
position independent, this runtime relocation is not needed.
<p>
The other problem is that of relocation of references to symbols defined in a
library from the user program.  In this case, the static linker <i>can</i> 
determine the address at which the library will be loaded.  However, it does
not rely on this information since if the library changes, this information
may become incorrect.  However, for efficiency reasons, we do not wish to
perform dynamic relocations in the user program itself.  Consider the example
shown in the following figure where the main program calls a function f
defined in a dynamically linked library.  At static linking time, the address
of the function f is not known, and yet we do not wish to relocate this
reference at runtime.  The solution to this problem is to use a 
PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) and a GOT (Global Offset Table) in the program.

<h4>Global Offset Table (GOT) and Procedure Linkage Table (PLT)</h4>
<p align="justify">The Global Offset Table is a data table which contains the 
actual addresses of library symbols used from the program.  The Procedure
Linkage Table contains a small piece of code for each library function called
from the program.  At static linking time, the call to a library function from
the program is relocated such that the target address of the call instruction
is the address of the PLT entry in the program for the function.  Thus when
the program calls this function, the control actually reaches the code in the
corresponding PLT entry.  This code jumps to the actual location of the called
function using an indirect call instruction.  The target address for the call
is obtained from the GOT entry for the function.  The entries in the GOT are
initialized at dynamic linking time by the dynamic linker.  This scheme has
the advantage that only one GOT entry needs to be filled in for each
library function called from the program irrespective of the number of call
sites for the function.
<p align="justify">
The PLT code usually implements <i>lazy binding</i>.
In lazy binding, the actual address of the routine is resolved only when the 
routine is called for the first time. After that, the PLT entry jumps directly 
to the actual address, so after the first call, the cost of using the PLT is a 
single extra indirect jump at a procedure call. 
<a href="files\lazy.html">Here</a> is a cutout from a reference having a more 
detailed description of how the lazy binding exactly works.
<p>
For each library variable referenced from the program, space is created in the 
executable itself. References to the variable from the program refer to this 
address. The advantage of allocating space for library variables in the 
executable itself is that the program code does not need to be relocated at 
run-time, even if the library code subsequently changes. Only the code of 
libraries needs to be relocated at run-time.
<p align="justify">But still the code of library  needs to be relocated, and 
thus, we  require as many copies of library code in the physical memory as are 
the number of processes using the shared library. Consider the following case 
as an example.
<p align="center"><img src="images\img4.jpg" width="699" height="233"><br>
</p>
<p align="justify">In this example, run time relocation will have to be done 
in the code of &quot;library 1&quot; for symbol ADD_PLT_G. Most programs use 
the commonly available libraries such as the standard C library. It would 
obviously be efficient if these processes could share the library code in 
physical memory. However, in the above scheme, since the library code needs to 
be relocated at runtime, this is not possible. The solution is to have 
libraries that do not require relocation. The code for such libraries needs to 
be position independent (called Position Independent Code (PIC)). </p>

<A name = "topic8"></A>
<h4>Position Independent Code (PIC)</h4>
<p align="justify">Position independent code does not require relocation as it 
is able to determine its address at runtime. For this, the comiler must 
generate code differently so that runtime address determination is used. 
Using this technique, the addresses of their PLT and GOT can be determined by 
libraries at runtime. The code of these libraries can thus be shared by all 
processes using them as there remains no need of having multiple copies of the 
same. This results in a very substantial saving in physical memory 
requirements. Let us consider an example to see how position independent code 
works.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images\img5.jpg" width="699" height="349"><br>
Fig. 5</p>
<p>Here is the description of what is happening in the above example:</p>
<table width="100%"  border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign = "top">f: </td>
    <td>	<p>....<br>
      ....<br>
      call relative(4) <br>
    </p>
	</td>
    <td>
	....<br>
    ....<br>
    // relative call. It pushes the address of &quot;next&quot; instruction on the stack
	and jumps to the next instruction </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign = "top">NEXT:</td>
    <td>
	pop R1<br>
    call R1(DIFF)	</td>
    <td>
	// now R1 contains the address of this instruction <br>
    // DIFF is the offset of function g() from the instruction &quot;pop R1&quot;	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign = "top">......</td>
    <td>......</td>
    <td>......</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign = "top">......</td>
    <td>......</td>
    <td>// After DIFF bytes from NEXT </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign = "top">g:</td>
    <td>....</td>
    <td>// implementation of g starts here </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="justify">The code in function f() automatically computes its address 
at runtime and, knowing the offset to function g(), calls the function g().
</p>
<p align="justify">So, when a PLT entry for an external function is created, 
its offsets from the calling instructions are computed and are filled in at 
the appropriate places in the (compiler) generated position independent code. 
As a real example, <a href="files\hello.c">here</a> is the hello.c program and 
<a href="files\hello.s">here</a> is the compiler 
(gcc -O -fPIC -S -o hello.s hello.c) generated position independent code for 
the same. </p>
