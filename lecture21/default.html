<h3>About this lecture</h3>
In the previous lecture we looked at deadlocks and deadlock prevention algorithms which
ensured (by restraining how requests can be made) that one of the necessary conditions for
deadlock cannot occur and thus prevented deadlocks. Low device utilization and reduced system
throughput are some possible side effects of preventing deadlocks by this method.
In this lecture we will study Deadlock avoidance and detection algorithms.

<h3>Deadlock Avoidance</h3>
In this deadlock handling technique, no particular discipline of resource 
requests is expected from the program.  Instead, the resource
allocator considers each request at runtime, and decides whether, if the
requested resources are immediately granted (assuming of course that they
are available), the system might <i>later</i> get into a deadlocked state.
If the answer is yes, resources are not immediately granted and the requesting
process is made to wait even though the resources are available.
Thus the resource allocation algorithm always keeps the system in a 
`safe' state.
Such an algorithm, however, requires apriori information about what resources 
a process may request and use in its lifetime.
Various algorithms vary on the amount and type of information required. 
The simplest and the most useful one is the model in which the maximum number 
of resources of each type that may be needed by a process in its lifetime is 
known apriori.  We will study the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance
which uses this this information.

<h3>Safe States, Unsafe States and Safe Sequences</h3>
As discussed above, a deadlock avoidance algorithm characterizes system states 
as safe and unsafe states, and then tries to keep the system always in a
safe state.  Clearly, for this approach to be useful, the set of unsafe
states must be a superset of the deadlocked states, so that deadlocks never
occur in the system.  
A safe state is not a deadlocked state. An unsafe state may or may not be
a deadlocked state but it may lead to a deadlocked state.
The relationship between safe, unsafe, and deadlocked state is depicted
by the figure below.

<p align="center">

<p align="center"> <i>Safe, Unsafe and Deadlocked States</i>

<p>
One way to define safe states is as follows.
The worst scenario is that in which each process requests for <i>all</i> the
resources that it could possibly ask for.
Now if in a state the system can allocate the maximum required resources to all
processes in some order (and thus avoid a deadlock), then that state is a 
<i>safe</i> state. To be more precise let us define
the notion of a safe sequence.
<p>
<i>Safe Sequences</i> : A sequence of processes <P1, P2, ..., Pn> is a safe 
sequence for the current state if the maximum resource requirement of any 
P<i>i</i> can be satisfied by:
<ul>
<li> resources currently held by P<i>i</i>, <i>and</i>
<li> resources currently available, <i>and</i>
<li> resources held by all P<i>j</i>, where <i>j</i> < <i>i</i>.
</ul>
A state is safe if and only if there is a safe sequence for that state.
If no such sequence exists then that state is said to be <i>unsafe</i>.
Consider the following example.  Assume that the system has
12 instances of a single resource type.  Assume that the
maximum resource requirements and current allocations for different processes
is as shown in the table below.

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>Process</td><td>Max Requirement</td><td>Current Allocation</td></tr>
<tr><td>P0</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>P1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>P2</td><td>9</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Thus there are 3 instances of the resource currently available.
Suppose, in this state, all three process request for the maximum
number of resources that they are permitted to (5, 2, and 7 respectively).
The system can satisy these requests as follows.  First P1 is given
2 instances.  Since P1 now has all the resources it needs, it will
ultimately finish and release all its resources.  At that stage
the available resources would be 5.  Now P0 can be given the resources
it needs.  When P0 finishes, there will be 10 resource instances available
using which P2's requirement can be satisfied.  Thus, <P1, P0, P2> is a safe 
sequence for this state, and hence this state is a safe state.

<p>
Suppose that in this state, P2 asks for and is granted one more instance
of the resource.  The resulting state would be the following.
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>Process</td><td>Max Requirement</td><td>Current Allocation</td></tr>
<tr><td>P0</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>P1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>P2</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Convince yourself that there is no safe sequence for this state, and hence
this state is unsafe.  Therefore, the deadlock avoidance algorithm must
<i>not</i> immediately satisfy this most recent request of P2 even though
the requested resource is available.

<h3>Banker's Algorithm</h3>
We have already seen the basic ideas behind the Banker's algorithm above.
We now state the algorithm more formally.  Essentially, when a request
is made, the state that would result if the request is granted is computed 
and checked for safety.  The request is granted only if the resulting state 
is safe.

<p>
Let <i>n</i> be the number of processes in the system and 
let <i>m</i> be the number of resource types.
The following data structures are mainatained by the Banker's algorithm.
<dl>
<dt><tt>int available</tt>[<i>m</i>]
<dd>A vector of length <i>m</i> indicating the number of available 
resources of each type.  <tt>available</tt>[<i>j</i>] = <i>k</i> 
implies that <i>k</i> instances of resource type <i>R<sub>j</sub></i> are 
currently available.
<dt><tt>int max</tt>[<i>n</i>,<i>m</i>]
<dd>An <i>n</i> X <i>m</i> matrix defining the maximum resource
requirement of each process.  <tt>max</tt>[<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>] = <i>k</i> 
implies that process <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> can request at most <i>k</i> 
instances of resource type <i>R<sub>j</sub></i>.
<dt><tt>int allocation</tt>[<i>n</i>,<i>m</i>]
<dd>An <i>n</i> X <i>m</i> matrix giving the current resource
allocation of each process.  <tt>allocation</tt>[<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>] 
= <i>k</i> implies that process <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> currently holds <i>k</i> 
instances of resource type <i>R<sub>j</sub></i>.
<dt><tt>int need</tt>[<i>n</i>,<i>m</i>] = <tt>max</tt> - 
	<tt>allocation</tt>
<dd>An <i>n</i> X <i>m</i> matrix indicating the remaining resource
needs of each process.
</dl>

We now introduce some notation for ease of exposition.
<p>
Let <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> be vectors of length <i>n</i>.
<p>
<i>X</i> &le; <i>Y</i> iff <i>X</i>[<i>i</i>] &le; <i>Y</i>[<i>i</i>] for all 
<i>i</i> from  1 to <i>n</i>.
<p>
<i>X</i> < <i>Y</i> iff <i>X</i> &le; <i>Y</i> and <i>X</i> &ne; <i>Y</i>.
<p>
For a matrix <i>A</i>[<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>], <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the 
<i>i</i><sup>th</sup> row of <i>A</i>.
For example, <tt>allocation</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> specifies the resources 
currently allocated to process <i>P<sub>i</sub></i>.

<p>
<b>Overall Algorithm</b>
<p>
Let <i>R<sub>i</sub></i> (vector of size <i>m</i>) be the current 
request made by <i>P<sub>i</sub></i>.

<ol>
<li>
If <tt>need</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> < <i>R<sub>i</sub></i> then 
refuse the request.  Return
<li>
If <tt>available</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> < <i>R<sub>i</sub></i> then 
make <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> wait.  Return.
<li>
Compute the state that would result if <i>R<sub>i</sub></i> is granted as
follows.
<blockquote>
	<tt>allocation</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 
		<tt>allocation</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> + 
			<i>R<sub>i</sub></i>;<br>
	<tt>available</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 
		<tt>available</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> - 
		<i>R<sub>i</sub></i>;<br>
	<tt>need</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 
		<tt>need</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> - 
		<i>R<sub>i</sub></i> ;
</blockquote>
If the computed state is safe (see safety algorithm below), grant the request 
else make <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> wait and undo changes to the state.
</ol>

<b>Safety Algorithm</b>
<p>
Let <tt>Work</tt> and <tt>Finish</tt> be vectors of length of 
length <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> respectively.
<ol>
<li>
Initializations:
<blockquote>
<tt>Work</tt> = <tt>available</tt>;<br>
For <i>i</i> from 1 to <i>n</i>, <tt>Finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] = false;
</blockquote>
<li>
Find an <i>i</i> such that <tt>Finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] is false and 
<tt>need</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> &le; <tt>Work</tt>.
If no such <i>i</i> exists goto step 4.
<li>
<tt>
Work = Work + allocation<sub><i>i</i></sub>;
Finish[i] = true;
</tt>
<br>
goto step 2.
<li>
If <tt>Finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] is true for all 
<i>i</i> from 1 to <i>n</i>, then the state is safe,
else the state is unsafe.
</ol>
Note that due to the monotonically increasing value of the vector
<tt>Work</tt>, we do not need any backtracking in the algorithm.
<p>
The Banker's algorithm handles multiple instances of resource types. 
The algorithm has a complexity of <i>O</i>(<i>mn</i><sup>2</sup>).
However, if every resource has a single instance, a faster algorithm can be 
used (described below).<p>

<h3>Deadlock Avoidance using Resource Allocation Graph</h3>
If the system has only one instance of each resource type,
a more efficient algorithm that uses a variant of the
RAG can be used for deadlock avoidance.
<p>
Introduce a new type of edges called <i>claim edges</i> to the RAG. 
A claim edge from <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> to <i>R<sub>j</sub></i> indicates that 
process <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> may request resource <i>R<sub>j</sub></i> 
at some time in future. Such edges are shown by dashed arrows. 
When <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> actually requests resource <i>R<sub>j</sub></i>,
the claim edge is converted to a request edge, and to an allocation edge
on resource assignment. Similarly when a 
resource <i>R<sub>j</sub></i> is released by process <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> 
the assignment edge is reconverted to a claim edge. 
Also, before any process starts executing, all its claim edges must already 
be present in the RAG (denoting apriori knowledge of resource requirements
of all processes).
<p>
Convince yourself that a state is unsafe if and only if the corresponding
RAG has a cycle.  Thus when a process <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> requests 
(available) resource <i>R<sub>j</sub></i>, its request is granted only if 
on converting the claim edge to assignment edge does not result in the 
formation of a cycle in the RAG.
<p>
As an example, consider the following RAG.
 
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="img183.png" width="369" height="263"></p>

This RAG has no cycles and represents a safe state since <P1, P2> is a 
safe sequence for the state.
Now suppose that P2 requests R2. In spite of R2 being free it cannot
be allocated to P2 since this action would create a cycle in the graph and
hence would result in an unsafe state.

<h3>Deadlock Detection and Recovery</h3>
If a system neither employs deadlock prevention nor deadlock avoidance, 
a deadlock may occur.  In this case, the only possible way to deal with
a deadlock is to detect it after it has occurred and try to recover
from it.  Here is a deadlock detection algorithm.  Note that the
deadlock detection algorithm is similar to the Banker's algorithm
except that it works with the current resource requests of each
process (<i>R<sub>i</sub></i>) instead of its maximum possible request
(<tt>need</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub>).

<p>
<b>Deadlock Detection Algorithm</b>
<ol>
<li>
Initialization:
<blockquote>
   <tt>Work</tt> = <tt>available</tt>; <br>
   For all <i>i</i> from 1 to <i>n</i>, <tt>Finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] = 
	(<tt>allocation</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub> == 0 );
</blockquote>
<li>
Find an <i>i</i> such that <tt>Finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] is false and 
<i>R<sub>i</sub></i> &le; <tt>Work</tt>[<i>i</i>].
   If no such <i>i</i> exists goto step 4.
<li>
<tt>Finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] = false;
<tt>Work</tt> = <tt>Work</tt> + <tt>allocation</tt><sub><i>i</i></sub>;
<br>
goto step 2
<li>
If <tt>finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] is true for all <i>i</i> from 1 to <i>n</i>,
there is no deadlock, else there is a deadlock, and all processes
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> for which <tt>finish</tt>[<i>i</i>] is false
are involved in the deadlock.
</ol>

The complexity of this deadlock detection algorithm is again
<i>O</i>(<i>mn</i><sup>2</sup>).  Again, if there is only one
instance of every resource, a simpler algorithm can be used ---
a state is deadlocked if and only if the corresponding RAG
(without the claim edges) has a cycle.

<b>Deadlock Recovery</b><p>
Using a deadlock detection scheme to deal with deadlocks involves
tricky issues with no easy answers.  For example, how often should
the deadlock detection algorithm be run?  If it is run too frequently,
it would result in a large overhead.  On the other hand, deadlocks
that go undetected for large periods of time are clearly undesirable
since they lead to wastage of resources.  For recovering from a 
deadlock, the only options are: to kill some processes, or to 
forcibly take away some resources from some processes.  For some
resources, the latter may not be feasible.  If one chooses to
kill some processes, the decision may be made on the basis of
process priorities etc.

<h3>Deadlock Handling in Practice</h3>
In practice, deadlock avoidance has too high a runtime overhead
to be practical.  Deadlock detection, besides being expensive,
has other practical problems mentioned above.  Deadlock prevention,
therefore, is the most practical approach to handling deadlocks.
<p>
Since the kernel also executes concurrently on behalf of multiple
processes that share several resources, deadlocks are an area of
concern in kernel design as well.  From the point of view of the
kernel, resource requests can be of two kinds: those that are
explicitly made by user processes, such as requests to lock a
file, access a device in exclusive mode etc.; and those that the
kernel code makes on behalf of user processes in order to provide
services to these processes.  Examples of the latter include
various kernel locks etc., used by the kernel for synchronization
purposes.  Generally, deadlocks caused due to the first kind of
resource requests are considered application responsibility, and
the kernel makes no guarantees that deadlocks will not occur.
Potential deadlocks due to the second kind of resource requests
are, however, clearly the responsibility of the kernel, and the
kernel code must ensure that such deadlocks do not occur.
Usually, some deadlock prevention techniques are used to ensure
this.
