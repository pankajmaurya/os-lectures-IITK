<h4>
About this Lecture
</h4>

<p>

In this lecture, we shall see the concept of signals in details mainly in 
reference to the Unix like Operating Systems.
We shall also talk about the kernel
level details in signal handling: the signal disposition, signal bit vector etc.
We shall also see how to block signals to prevent them from interrupting 
sensitive processing.
Finally we shall see the effects of system calls - execve and 
fork on the signal data structures.

<h4>What are Signals?</h4>
<p>
Signals are an inter-process synchronization mechanism.
They cannot communicate data but only
the occurrence of events.
By their nature, they interrupt whatever the process was doing when the
signal was received,
and force it to handle them immediately.
They are thus a software analog of exceptions and
interrupts (see lecture 2).
From the point of view of the process they are sent to, they can
be synchronous or asynchronous.

-->




<a name= "use"></a>
<h4>Signals: Uses and Causes</h4>
<p>
Signals are usually used by the operating system to notify a process of
the occurrence of some event,
without requiring the process to poll for the event. 
Signals can also be 
used by a process to communicate event occurrence to another process.
</p>

<p>
Signals can be generated due to numerous events and conditions.
They can be grouped into:
	<ul>    
	<li>
	<b><i>exception-related events</i></b><br>
Events such as floating point error, illegal address
access etc. result in exceptions at the hardware level, as we have seen earlier.
In response, the exception handler of the operating system usually delivers a 
signal to the process which caused the exception to occur.
	<br>

	<li>
	<b><i>software conditions </i></b><br>
Processes encounter unusual conditions that need to be taken care of,
for example:
		<ul>
		<li>  a process writes to a pipe for which there are no
			readers left.
		<li> an alarm set by the process goes off.
		</ul>    

	<li>
	<b><i>inter-process coordination and communication</i></b><br>
One process notifies the other of an event or condition.
For example:
		<ul>
		<li>   
      process A has completed an activity, and notifies process B about it, e.g. so that B can use the results.
		<li>      
	   if process B is a child of A, B notifies A when it terminates.
		</ul>

		<li>
		<b><i>interaction between users and processes</b></i><br>

There are certain key presses that are interpreted by the system as requests to send signals to the process with which we are interacting:
			<ul>
    				<li>
     Ctrl-C
     Pressing this key causes the system to send an INT signal (SIGINT) to the 
processes running in the foreground on the terminal.  By default, this signal
causes a process to terminate immediately.
    				</li>
    
    				<li>
    Ctrl-Z
    Pressing this key causes the system to send a STOP signal (SIGSTOP) to the 
processes running in the foreground on the terminal.     By default, this signal causes the process to suspend execution. 
    				</li>
    
    				<li>
    Ctrl-\
    Pressing this key causes the system to send a ABRT signal (SIGABRT) to the running process.     By default, this signal causes the process to immediately terminate with a core dump.
    				</li>
			</ul>
  
</ul>

<h4>Unix Signals</h4>
<p>
Unix defines a number of signals for various situations.
Each signal is associated with a signal number.  The symbolic
names for various signals are usually defined in the system header file 
<tt>/usr/include/signal.h</tt>.

A list of the common signals is shown below.

<pre>
    Signal     Default Action Description
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SIGINT     Terminate.     Interrupt. Generated when we enter CNTRL-C
    SIGSTOP    Stop           Stop process
    SIGILL     Core dump      Generated when we executed an illegal instruction
    SIGSEGV    Core dump      Generated in case of illegal address
    SIGFPE     Core dump      Floating Point error
    SIGCONT    Continue       Continue if stopped
    SIGUSR1    Terminate      User defiled signal 1
    SIGUSR2    Terminate      User defined signal 2
    SIGKILL    Terminate      Termination (can't catch, block, ignore)
    SIGCHLD    Ignore         A child process has terminated or stopped

<h4>Sending signals to Processes</h4>

<p>

This kill system call is the normal way of sending a signal from one process 
to another.
 <pre>
   int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);

<!--
	The Kernel's section
-->


<a name= "kernel"></a>
<h4>Signals : The inside story from the kernel</h4>

<p>

For each process the kernel maintains a signal disposition,
a blocked signals bit vector and a pending signals bit vector.


<ul>

<!--
	Signals Disposition subsection
-->

<li><b><i>Disposition of a signal</b></i><br>
 A signal's `disposition' is the action the process will take when it receives this signal. 
 Each signal has a default action, which is the action to be taken if the process does not 
 specify a disposition. A process can specify an other than the default to be 
 taken in response to any signal sent to it.
 The exceptions to this are SIGKILL and SIGSTOP, which cannot be caught, 
	ignored, or blocked.

 The disposition of a process for a signal can be: default, ignore (the receipt
 of the signal is ignored), or handled.  If a process wishes to handle a
 signal, it needs to specify the address of a function which should be called
 when the specified signal is received by the process.
</li>

<!--
	Signals Disposition changing subsection
--> 
<li><b><i>Changing the Signal disposition</b></i><br>
The system call <b>sigaction</b> can be used for this purpose.
<pre>
void sigaction(int signo, const struct sigaction *action, 
                   struct sigaction *old_action);
</pre>
Please see for details:
<pre>
     man 2 sigaction 	  
</pre>    

</li>

<li><b><i>Signal Delivery</b></i><br>
The kernel maintains for each process, a bit vector of signals
that have been delivered to the process but not yet been handled
by the process (pending signals).  Thus at the time of signal delivery, 
the appropriate bit in the pending signal bit vector of the target
process is simply set, and if the target process is sleeping, it is
woken up.  Note that this implies that if a process
receives another instance of a signal before handling the previous 
instance of the same signal, it will finally see just one instance
of the signal.  One signal instance will be `lost'.  Recall that
this is similar to what happens in the case of interrupts.

<!--
	Signals handling subsection
-->

<li><b><i>Signal Handling</b></i><br>
As seen, the signal delivery just marks the signal as pending in the
pending signal bit vector of the target process.  The signal is actually
handled when the process itself next runs on the CPU (even if the
disposition for the signal is to terminate the process).  More precisely,
a process just before returning from the kernel mode to the user mode
checks whether it has any pending signals, and if yes, it handles them
one by one.
<p>
Handling a signal for which the process has installed a signal handler
is a little involved.  The kernel, in this case, must ensure that the
process, when it returns to the user mode, starts executing the signal
handler function, and when this function returns, the process should
go back to the kernel, and then return again to the user mode at the
same point where it had originally entered the kernel (before the signal
was handled).  This return back to the kernel before resuming the
original execution is needed because a process can request certain
signals to be automatically <i>blocked</i>(see below) when a signal
handler is executed, and unblocked when the signal handler finishes.
This automatic unblocking requires the process to return to the
kernel mode after returning from the signal handler.  The kernel achieves
this by putting some code on the user stack, and setting the return
address from the signal handler function to point to this code.
This code makes a special <i>sigreturn</i> system call to return
control to the kernel.  All this is, of course, transparent to the
user program.

<!--
	Signals Blocking section
-->

<a name= "block"></a>
<h4>Avoiding signal races - Masking Signals.</h4>


<p>
<ul>
<!--
	The blocking need subsection
-->
<li><b><i>The need</b></i><br>

One of the nasty problems that might occur when handling a signal, 
is the occurrence of a 
second signal while the signal handler function executes. Such a signal might 
be of a different 
type than the one being handled, or even of the same type. Thus, we should 
take some precautions inside the signal handler function, to avoid races.  
Temporary blocking of signals gives you a way to prevent 
signals during critical parts of your code.
<p>
Signals can be blocked just like interrupts can be.  However, unlike interrupts,
there is no relative priority defined among signals.  The kernel maintains
a block signal bit vector for each process to keep track of the signals
which are currently blocked by the process.  A pending signal is not handled
by the process while it is blocked.  The <i>sigprocmask</i> system call
can be used to block signals.

<!--
	The blocking procedure subsection
-->

<li><b><i>The procedure</b></i><br>

The system call <b> sigprocmask </b> can be used to modify or examine the bitmask of blocked signals.

<pre>
int sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *set, sigset_t *oset); 
</pre>  
  
sigprocmask() accepts 3 parameters:<br>
<ol>

<li>
int how<br>
    defines if we want to add signals to the current process's mask (SIG_BLOCK),
    remove them from the current mask (SIG_UNBLOCK), 
    or completely replace the current mask with the new mask (SIG_SETMASK). 
    <br>
<li>    
const sigset_t *set<br>
    The set of signals to be blocked, or to be added to the current mask, 
    or removed from the current mask (depending on the 'how' parameter). 
    <br>	
    
<li>
sigset_t *oldset<br>
    If this parameter is not NULL, then it'll contain the previous mask. 
    We can later use this set to restore the situation back to 
    how it was before we called sigprocmask(). 
    <br>

<br>
sigset_t variables can be manipulated as illustrated below:
<pre>
/* define a new mask set */
sigset_t mask_set;

/* first clear the set (i.e. make it contain no signal numbers) */
sigemptyset(&mask_set);

/* lets add the INT signals to our mask set */
sigaddset(&mask_set, SIGINT);

/* finally, lets check if the INT signal is defined in our set */
if (sigismember(&mask_set, SIGINT)
    printf("signal INT is in our set\n");
else
    printf("signal INT is not in our set - how strange...\n");

/* finally, lets make the set contain ALL signals available on our system */
sigfillset(&mask_set)

</pre>

<!--
	The system call section
-->


<a name= "syscalls"></a>
<h4>Effects of system calls fork and execve on signal data structures. </h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
 During fork, the set of signal actions for a process is initialized from that of its parent. 
 
 The blocked signals vector, and the dispositions are inherited whereas the pending signals bit 
 
 vector is cleared.

<br><li>
During exec, signal dispositions of SIG_DFL and SIG_IGN remain unchanged. 
Signals whose 
dispositions specify handler functions are reset to SIG_DFL, i.e., 
the signals handled by user's 
handlers earlier are now handled in the default manner.The process's signal 
mask is 
unaffected by exec, i.e., the blocked signals continue to be blocked.

	The lecture summary section
-->

<a name= "summary"></a>
<h4>Lecture Summary</h4>

<p>
Signals are used to deal with asynchronous events that happen unexpectedly, at seemingly random 
times.
They can be caused by a variety of events or conditions, e.g. hardware-related events, 
software conditions, interactions between processes, and between the user and processes.
Careless use of signals can result in programs that work correctly most of the time, but may be 
prone to malfunctioning due to race conditions or other subtle problems
Newer versions of Unix provide mechanisms for handling signals reliably.
