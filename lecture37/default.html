<h4>
About this Lecture
</h4>
In the last lecture we dealt with Inode Allocation policy, we would now discuss
Block Allocation policy. We will discuss about Caching in order to
minimise disk access which improves overall performance and would further discuss
about read ahead and delayed write policy in Caching. Finally we shall discuss
File System Inconsistencies.

<h4>
Block Allocation Policy
</h4>

<li><u>Global Policy </u></li>
<p>
<i> Aim :</i> Minimise the seek delay <br><br>
If it is the first file block then allocate a block in the CG where inode
of the file is present else try to allocate a new block for a file in the
same CG as the previous block of the file.
<br>
We can easily analyse that soon we would be filling the same CG, we should
not overdo this as there might be other files growing in the same CG.
Hence we should decide on a upper limit on the size of file on a specific CG.
<br>
When 25% of the CG is occupied by a file then it needs to be redirected
to another CG.<br>
</p>

<li><u>Local Policy</u><br></li>
<p>
<i> Aim :</i>Minimise the rotational delay <br><br>
Having selected the CG, which block should we chose within the CG! <br>
The policy says to handle requests for specific blocks, use them if they are
available, else check for a sequence of alternatives. The policy can be stated
in the following format.
</p><ol>
<li>Allocate Rotationally Optimal block in the same cylinder (w.r.t previous block of file) </li>
<li>If that is not free, allocate rotationally closest block within the same cylinder.</li>
<li>If no block in the same cylinder is available, allocate any block in the same CG that was allocated. </li>
<li>If the cylinder group is full, rehash to get a new cylinder group and look there for a new block. </li>
<li>If the above fails, use an exhaustive search for all cylinder groups. </li>
</ol>

<h4>
Caching
</h4>

<p>
In addition to the hardware caching, most operating systems use software <em>disk
caching</em>. Since the system memory is many orders of magnitude faster than the hard disk,
a small area of system memory is set aside to buffer requests to the hard disk. When reading
data from the disk, the kernel intially attempts to read from the buffer cache. If the data
is already in the cache, the kernel does not have to read from the disk or else it reads the
data from the disk and caches it for further use.
</p>

</p>

<p>The global inode table also serves as the Inode Cache. The inode cache contains copies
of inodes for open files and for some recently used files which are no longer open. The
number of inodes cached is controlled by some parameter(maximum no of Files to be Cached).<br>
The Directory Entry Cache contains the copies of directory entries which are predicted to
be used frequently.<br>
Device drivers do not know about the FS structure so the Cache present simply caches
disk blocks without knowing what it contains. The input would be device number and disk
block number and it would use some hashing scheme to return the block if present in cache,
else fetches it from memory and then according to cache eviction policy stores it in cache
for future use.

<p>
Valid bit checks the validity of the object in the cache. The free/locked bit informs whether
the cache location is free or locked. Free bit says that if no one is using the object
then it can be used.<br>
We can easily see that if the valid bit is false then necessarily the free bit should
be true. Whereas if the valid bit is true, the free bit can be both true and false,
viz both valid and free bit are true when some valid data is used by none.<br>
If both valid and locked are true then we have to wait, if free then make it locked &amp;
remove it from free list and start using it.<br><br><i>When should a value be locked into the cache</i><br>
<i>Disk cache :</i> for the duration of the system call.<br>
<i>Inode cache :</i> for the time that the file is open.

<!-----Cache Data Structure and LRU---------->
<p></p><hr>
<a name="Topic4"> </a>
<h4>
Cache Data Structure
</h4>

<p>
The  Disk Block Cache uses a indexed hash table using a  doubly linked list to store
blocks. Some hash function is used to hash the device number and the block number to
the list. All buffers with data from blocks corresponding to a hash value are linked
in a hash list corresponding to this hash value. A free list is also formed using all
the free buffers.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="default_files/hash.jpg" border="2">
</p>

<h4>
Least Recently Used replacement policy (LRU)
</h4>
<p>
Cache Misses are responsible for Cache evictions. To deal with Cache evictions we need some
good policy to boost the performance, and LRU seems to do the trick. We can implement exact
LRU by following these steps:
</p><ol type="i">
<li>Whenever we free a buffer (unlock), we add it to the end of the free list.</li>
<li>Whenever we need to take something we take it from the head of free list.</li>
Hence the free list would be sorted in order of access time.
</ol>

<!------Read ahead and Delayed Write ---------->
<p>
</p><hr>
<a name="Topic5"> </a>

<h4>
Read Ahead
</h4>
<p>
It is an algorithm that tries to save as much good data in the cache as possible. <br>
When a cache miss occurs say for the <i>i</i>th block, we need to read it from disk.
Our algorithm suggests us to read the <i>i+1</i>th block after we have read <i>i</i>th
block in anticipation that it would be read soon.<br>
The Disk I/O for <i>i+1</i>th block would be done in background which might be overlapping
with the execution of some program.
</p>
The algorithm would be
<pre>	while(not eof(f)){
		read(f,buffer,N)
		process(buffer)
	}
</pre>
<p>
When the buffer is being processed, disk may be busy as data may be read. By the time
processing is completed we may get the next data in Cache and if we are lucky the next
data request would have been fetched via read ahead and we won't need to wait for the
next data through a Disk I/O. Similarly when <i>i+1</i>th block is processed we might
have read ahead <i>i+2</i>th block. We are sure to gain in terms of performance.
</p>

<h4>
Delayed Write
</h4>
<p>
Our algorithm tries to minimize the frequency of disk write operations. <br>
It tries to determine whether the data must be stored immediately on disk .We might
be wasting Disk I/O as
</p><ol type="i">
<li>The data may be transient which would be overwritten soon. or </li>
<li>It may be a temporary file which would get deleted (of no further use).</li>
</ol>
The reliability issues say that we can&#8217;t hold the data for long, we need to flush the
data frequently because the holding may lead to data loss due to power failure or
Hardware failure (computer hangs). Hence a Daemon runs in background which would flush
the data with dirty bit set. Meta-Data(including directories information) is flushed
more often than data blocks as there is danger of landing up into corrupt file system.

<!------File System Inconsistencies---------->
<p>
</p><hr>
<a name="Topic6"> </a>
<h4>
File System Inconsistencies
</h4>
<p>
Since files and directories are kept in main memory and on disk, care must be taken to
ensure that system failure does not result in loss of data or data inconsistencies.
File System Inconsistencies mainly arise due to delayed writes, where we tend to gain
on speed by sacrificing on reliability.<br>
File system can become inconsistent due to several reasons and the most common is abnormal
shutdown due to hardware failure, power failure or switching off the system without
proper shutdown. Due to these reasons the super block in a file system is not updated and
has mismatched information  relating to system data blocks, free blocks and inodes.
Generally a special program <i>fsck</i>(file system check) a Unix utility is used for
checking and repairing file system inconsistencies .
There is lot of redundant data which helps the program to check for the inconsistencies, viz-
</p><ol type="i">
<li>Bitmap of used and free inodes.
</li><li>Each inode has a flag which says used or free.
</li></ol>

We try to recover the file inconsistencies by :-
<li>Scanning  all inodes to check that each block is in exactly one file, or on the free
list, but not both.</li>
<li>We also check that the number of links to each file (part of the metadata in the file's
inode) is correct (by looking at all directories).</li>
Explanation:
Root directory has fixed number (generally 2), we can check this and then recursively for
the entire tree. For each directory entry we can find out the inodes used. For each inode
count the number of links and check if it matches the link count, if it doesn&#8217;t then we
try to correct it .<br>
We can decrease the link count as required, for e.g if link count = 2 but the directory
entry = 1 then we can fix it by assigning the value of dir entry to link count. If link
count is finite but no directory entry exist then we create a link with <em>/lost+found
</em>directory. We try to bring it back to some consistent state as we cannot go
to the exact state, otherwise inconsistency would not have arrived.<br>
Super block has a bit which says that the File System was cleanly unmounted.
