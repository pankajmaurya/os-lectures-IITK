Context Switching - when and how it occurs
</h4>
We have already seen what scheduling is and when it occurs.  To recapitulate,
scheduling occurs whenever the currently running process either voluntarily
relinquishes the CPU (because it is terminating or going to sleep) or when
it is forced to (by, for example, the clock interrupt handler; this is called
<i>preemption</i>).  In either case, a scheduler function in the kernel code
is called (in the context of the currently running process).  The scheduler 
function uses the scheduling strategy to select the
most eligible ready to run process for running next on the CPU.  It then
needs to perform a <i>context switch</i> from the currently running process
to this selected process.
<p>
Context switch from one process to another process requires saving the 
state of the  currently running process and loading the saved state of the new 
process. The major components of the ``process state'' that need to be switched
are its address translation tables, and the values of CPU registers.
The address translation tables for all processes are usually always in memory,
so switching them is simply a matter of changing the special CPU register
that holds a pointer to the address translation tables to point to the
address translation tables for the new process.  This value can be obtained
from the PCB of the new process.
<p>
Note that the switching of the address translation tables has no immediate
effect since the execution is currently within the kernel, and typically
the kernel code and data is mapped to the same part of the virtual
address space of each process (with protection mechanisms to ensure that
this part of the address space can only be accessed in the supervisor mode
of the processor).
<p>
Next, the current CPU state of the currently running process needs to be
saved and the previously saved state of the new process needs to be restored.
The CPU state consists essentially of the values of the CPU registers.
To do this, an assembly coded switch routine is called.  The switch
routine simply saves all register values in the PCB
of the current process and restores these values from the PCB of the new 
process.
<p>
Note that when the current process had entered the kernel (through an interrupt
or trap etc.), its CPU state had been saved.  However this saved CPU state 
reflected the state of the user level computation at the time the interrupt
occurred or the trap was executed.  Within the kernel, the process then
followed some path of execution and acquired some CPU state.  This is the
CPU state that must be saved at the time of context switch.
<p>
Note also that the stack stores a substantial amount of state that forms the
``execution history'' for a process.  This does not need to be explicitly
saved though since the stack is already in memory.  What does need to be saved
is the current stack pointer value which is held in a register and hence
gets saved by the switch routine.  Since the switch routine also restores
the stack pointer value for the new process, effectively once the register
value restoration is complete, the stack of the new process is being used.
Thus the switch routine returns in the context of the new process!
<p>
The variable <i>current</i> that holds a pointer to the PCB of the currently
running process also needs to be changed during context switch.  This is,
of course, a simple matter.

<b>Note: </b>When a process executes in the kernel, it uses a different stack
than the one that it uses in user mode.  The kernel allocates a fixed sized
kernel stack for every process at the time of process creation.
Immediately on entering the kernel (through an interrupt, trap etc.),
the stack pointer register is changed (by the interrupt handler code) to 
point to the kernel stack.  The old value of the stack
pointer is of course saved first to the kernel stack.
<p>
The user stack and the kernel stack must be different for 
the following reasons:
<ol> <li>When the process was running in the kernel mode the
stack might have carried some sensitive values which should not be revealed to 
the user. Even after these values are popped they are not physically
 erased from the memory and hence are accessible to the user if the process has a common stack for user and kernel mode execution.
<br>
 <li> While executing in the kernel mode the process should not run out
of stack. If the process runs out of stack in the user mode, an exception 
occurs. But this should not happen when the process is in the 
kernel mode.
