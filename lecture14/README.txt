Overview
The lecture discusses algorithms that ensure only one process can access a critical section at a time, assuming atomic read/write operations to memory locations. The solutions must satisfy three key properties:

Mutual Exclusion: Only one process in critical section at a time
Progress: Decision-making completes in finite time
Bounded Wait: Limited waiting time for processes

Two-Process Solutions
Solution 1 (Flag-based)

Uses boolean flags to indicate intent to enter critical section
Problem: Fails progress property - both processes can set flags simultaneously, causing deadlock

Solution 2 (Turn-based)

Uses a turn variable to alternate access between processes
Problem: Fails progress property - a process not wanting to enter can block others

Solution 3 (Combined approach)

Combines flags and turn variables
Process can enter if it's their turn OR the other process doesn't want to enter
Success: Satisfies all three properties

Bakery Algorithm (Multi-process solution)
This algorithm extends the solution to handle any number of processes:

Concept: Like a bakery numbering system - processes get token numbers and are served in order
Token assignment: token[i] = max(all_tokens) + 1
Tie-breaking: Lower process ID wins when tokens are equal
Implementation: Uses choosing[] array to coordinate token selection

Key features:

Processes not wanting to enter get token 0
Total ordering ensures fairness: (i, token[i]) < (j, token[j]) if token[i] < token[j] or tokens equal but i < j
Successfully satisfies all three mutual exclusion properties

The bakery algorithm provides a complete solution for mutual exclusion among multiple processes without requiring special hardware support, relying only on atomic read/write operations.
