In this lecture, we discuss some classical algorithms for solving the
mutual exclusion problem.  All these solutions assume that a single
read or a single write to a memory location executes atomically with
respect to concurrent accesses to the same memory location.  This is
a reasonable assumption since it holds for both uni-processors and 
multi-processors.  We first try to come up with a solution for the
simpler version of the problem that involves just two processes.  Then
we see the <i>bakery algorithm</i> that solves the problem for any
number of processes.

<h4>
Two Process Solution
</h4>
We assume two processes: P<sub>0</sub>, and P<sub>1</sub>.
In the following algorithms, one or more of the following shared
variables are used.
<ul>
<li><tt>boolean flag[2]</tt> initialized to all false.
<li><tt>int turn</tt> initialized to 0 or 1.
</ul>
<tt>i</tt>, and <tt>j</tt> are assumed to be local variables in each process, 
with values 0 and 1 respectively in process P<sub>0</sub>, 
and 1 and 0 respectively in process P<sub>1</sub>.
<p>
<b>Solution 1:</b> Whenever a process P<sub>i</sub> wishes to enter the 
critical section, it sets flag[i] to true, and on exiting the critical
section, sets it back to false.   Thus flag[i] represents whether or not
process P<sub>i</sub> wishes to enter the critical section (or is already
in the critical section).  
Clearly, the process should check if the other flag is false while entering 
to ensure mutual exclusion.  Thus, a process P<sub>i</sub> executes the
following code.
<pre>
		P<sub>i</sub>:
		while (1) {
		 	non-critical code
			------------------
			flag[i] = true; // Notification of intent to enter critical code.
			while(flag[j]); // Do nothing till other process's flag is set.
			------------------
			critical code
			------------------
			flag[i] = false; // While exiting, setting flag to false.
			-------------------
			non-critical code
		}
</pre>
We verify whether the solution satisfies the three properties: <br>
<ol>
<li>Mutual Exclusion : If process P<sub>i</sub> is in critical section, flag[i] is set and so, P<sub>j</sub> cannot be in the
critical section. Since, the two processes can never be in the critical section together, this property is satisfied by the
solution.
<li>Progress : Suppose P<sub>i</sub> is running and `flag[i] = true;' is 
executed. Then a context switch occurs and `flag[j] = true' is executed by
P<sub>j</sub>. Now both the flags are set and so the code in the next line 
`while(flag[j]);' keeps on executing in both the processes. 
So, the decision process will take an infinite amount of time in this case,
and thus, this solution does not satisfy the progress property.
<li>Bounded Wait : If P<sub>i</sub> notifies its intent of entering the 
critical section by setting flag[i], P<sub>j</sub>
cannot enter the critical section again as it is stopped from entering the 
code again by the loop 'while(flag[i]);'. 
So, after notification of will
to enter, the other process cannot enter the critical section an unbounded 
number of times, and hence the solution satisfies the bounded wait property.
</ol>

<b>Solution 2: </b> We allow the processes to enter the critical section o
ne-by-one by using the <tt>turn</tt> variable to indicate whose turn it is
next to enter the critical section.
We keep on flipping this variable to allow both processes in the critical
section one-by-one.
<pre>
		P<sub>i</sub>:
		while (1) {
		 	non-critical code
			-----------------
			while( turn != i); // If it is not i's turn then wait. 
                                           // Otherwise, enter the critical section.
			-----------------
			critical code
			-----------------
			turn = 1 - i;      // Now the turn is of the other process.
			-----------------
			non-critical code
		}
</pre>

As before we verify the properties for this solution. 
<ol>
<li><b>Mutual Exclusion</b> : When P<sub>i</sub> is in critical section, 
turn = i.  So, P<sub>j</sub> cannot be in the critical section.
Hence, this solution satisfies the mutual exclusion property.
<li><b>Progress</b> : Let turn be i, i.e., it is process P<sub>i</sub>'s 
turn to 
enter.  But even if P<sub>i</sub> does not wish to enter the critical section
and only P<sub>j</sub> does, the latter still cannot enter the critical
section since it is not P<sub>j</sub>'s turn.  
non-critical section. Now, if P<sub>j</sub> intends to enter, it can't do so as will have to wait till turn gets equal to j.
Thus, a process that does not want to enter the critical section 
is preventing another process from doing so.
So, this solution does not satisfy the progress property.
<li><b>Bounded Wait</b> : Both processes enter the critical section one-by-one. So, P<sub>j</sub> can enter at most only once between
P<sub>i</sub>'s notification of intent and entering the crtical section. So, bounded wait is satisfied by this solution.
</ol>

<b>Solution 3: </b> To eliminate the problems of the above two solutions, 
we combine key ideas of both.  Here, a process P<sub>i</sub> can enter the 
critical section if either it is P<sub>i</sub>'s turn or if it is 
P<sub>j</sub>'s turn but P<sub>j</sub> does not want to enter the critical 
section (flag[j] is false).
<pre>
			P<sub>i</sub>:
			while (1) {
			 	non-critical code
				---------------------------
				flag[i] = true; turn = j; // Notification of intent
				while(flag[j] && turn == j); //Waiting 
				----------------------------
				critical code
				----------------------------
				flag[i] = false;
				----------------------------
				non-critical code
			}
</pre>
<ol>
<li>Mutual Exculsion : If P<sub>0</sub> is in the critical section, 
flag[0] is set, and either flag[1] is false or turn = 0.
If flag[1] is false, P<sub>1</sub> is clearly not in the critical section. 
If turn = 0, then too P<sub>1</sub> cannot be in the critical section as both 
flag[0] and (turn = 0) are true.
Similar is the case when P<sub>0</sub> is in the critical section. 
Thus this solution satisfies the mutual exclusion property.
<li>Progress : Clearly, if P<sub>i</sub> does not want to enter, 
flag[i] will be false and so, P<sub>j</sub> can enter the critical
section immediately. To show that the decision process always
takes a bounded time, we assume that both the processes are interleaved in 
such a way that flag[0] and flag[1] are both set to true. 
But then, turn can be either equal to 0 or 1. So, one of the processes will 
clearly exit the loop 'while(flag[j] && turn == j)' and so, 
the decision process can be completed in bounded amount of time.
Thus, this solution also satisfies the progress property.
<li>Bounded Wait : If P<sub>i</sub> is waiting for a chance to enter the 
critical section, P<sub>j</sub> can only enter once before P<sub>i</sub> 
enters the 
critical section. This is so because flag[i] is set due to P<sub>i</sub>'s 
notification. If P<sub>j</sub> wants to
reenter then it sets turn = i and so it gets caught in the loop 
`while(flag[i] && turn ==i)' and cannot reenter till P<sub>i</sub>
enters and exits the critical code. So, the other process can enter at most once between notification of intent and entering
the critical section and thus, this solution satisfies 
the bounded wait property.
</ol>

Thus, we finally have a correct solution to the critical problem that meets
all the three requirements. The same solution can be extended  (non-trivially)
for the case of multiple processes. 
But, we examine a different solution to this problem called the
<i>Bakery Algorithm</i>
<p>

<h4>
Bakery Algorithm
</h4>
Here the processes are served the same way as customers in a bakery, 
hence the name. Every process is given a token number and the process 
with minimum token number is served first. When a process P<sub>i</sub> 
shows its will to enter by executing the entry code, it is assigned the
following token number: (we assume that there are a total of n processes)
t<sub>i</sub> = max(t<sub>1</sub>,t<sub>2</sub>...t<sub>n</sub>) + 1;

<p>
We can see that finding the maximum value of previous tokens is not an 
atomic statement and will be executed in many steps. 
So, if two processes start this calculation at the same time, they may get the 
same token number. To resolve such ties, the rule adopted is that among 
processes with the same token number, the lower numbered process will be
served first.
<p>
To express this idea precisely, define the relation &lt; as follows.

(i, t<sub>i</sub>) &lt; (j, t<sub>j</sub>) iff 
	t<sub>i</sub> &lt; t<sub>j</sub> or
	(t<sub>i</sub> = t<sub>j</sub> and i &lt; j) <br>

Thus the relation &lt; defines a total order on the pairs (i, t<sub>i</sub>).
Now if both P<sub>i</sub> and P<sub>j</sub> want to enter the critical section
at the same time, P<sub>i</sub> will be allowed to enter first
if (i, t<sub>i</sub>) &lt; (j, t<sub>j</sub>); otherwise P<sub>j</sub>
will be allowed to enter first.
<p>
Processes which do not want to enter the critical section are given token 
number 0. A process enters the critical section
only if all other processes have token numbers 0 or 
more than that of this process. 
We also use a variable 'choosing' for each
process which is true when this process is choosing the token and false when 
it is done choosing. This is done so that we have 
all processes finished choosing while finding the one with least token number.
The final code is the following.
<pre>
		P<sub>i</sub>:
		while (1) {
			non-critical code
			-----------------
			choosing[i] = true; // The process is choosing the token now.
			token[i] = max(token[1], token[2], ..., token[n]) + 1;
			choosing[i] = false; // Choosing complete
			for j = 1 to n except i do { //Compare with all other processes
			 	while(choosing[j]); // Wait till the process is finished choosing
				while(token[j] &ne; 0 and ((j, token[j]) &lt; (i, token[i])));
					// If there is another process with lesser token, then wait.
			}
			--------------------
			critical code
			--------------------
			token[i] = 0; // Set token number to 0 as this process has left the critical section
			--------------------
			non-critical code
		}
</pre>
Now we check if this solution satisfies the properties:
<ol>
<li>Mutual Exclusion : If process P<sub>i</sub> is running its critical code, then all other processes have token numbers 0 or greater than
token[i]. This is so because P<sub>i</sub> checks so before entering the critical section and also, any new process will have token number greater
than token[i]. So, no other process can enter till P<sub>i</sub> exits and token[i] is assigned to 0. Thus, this solution
satisfies mutual exclusion.
<li>Progress : If some process does not want to enter the critical section, 
its token number is 0 and so, it does not
prevent other processes from entering the critical section. 
Also, the decision process will take finite amount of time as there
is a total order on (i, t<sub>i</sub>) and so, the minimum of them 
will be found in finite time and this process that has the minimum value
is allowed to run. Note also the choosing[i] is true only for a finite time.
So, the solution satisfies the progress property.
<li>Bounded Wait : After a process P<sub>i</sub> gets a token number, some other process can enter only once before P<sub>i</sub>
gets the chance. This is so, because if the other process wants to reenter, it will be given a higher token number and so, can 
enter after P<sub>i</sub>. So, bounded wait is satisfied too.
</ol>
So, this solution too is a correct solution satisfying all the three requirements.
