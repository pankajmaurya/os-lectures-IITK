<h4>
About this Lecture
</h4>
In this lecture we will discuss another Virtual Address translation scheme 
called paging.  Variants of this scheme are typically used in modern processors.
We will discuss the issues involved in storing the translation tables and the 
techniques to speed up the translation.

<h4>
What is Paging?
</h4>
<p>
So, far we have seen two techniques, namely Contiguous Memory Allocation and 
Segmentation, for address translation.  The major problem that both
these techniques suffer from is that of external fragmentation.  External
fragmentation occurs because physical memory is allocated in variable sized
contiguous chunks.  Paging eliminates external fragmentation by ensuring that
requests for contiguous chunks of physical memory are always of the same size.
<p>
In paging, the virtual address space is divided into equal sized <i>pages</i>.
Each accessible page is mapped to an equal sized physical memory <i>frame</i>.
However, contiguous pages in the virtual address space need not map to
adjacent frames in the physical memory. A <i>page table</i> keeps track of the
mapping from virtual pages to physical frames.
<p>
With this scheme there is no problem of <b>external fragmentation</b> since
all requests for contiguous physical memory are of the same size (page or
frame size).  However, paging leads to the problem of <i>internal
fragmentation</i>.
Since memory is allocated in units of frames, more memory than needed may be
allocated in some cases. For example if the frame size is 1 KB and a process
requires 8604 bytyes of memory, it would be allocated 9 pages, i.e., 9216
bytes of which 612 bytes are wasted due to internal fragmentation.  On an
average, half a page of memory would be wasted per contiguous region in the
virtual address space.  If the page size is not too large, this wastage  is
not very significant.
<p>
The address translation with paging is similar to that with segmentation,
except that page size is fixed while segments could be variable sized.  
A virtual address is divided into two parts: the <i>page number</i> (<i>p</i>),
and the <i>page offset</i> (<i>d</i>). The page number is used as an index into 
a <i>page table</i>. A page table entry contains the frame number
the corresponding frame in the physical memory.
The frame number is combined with the page offset to obtain the physical
memory address location as illustrated below.

<i>Address translation with paging</i></p>
<p>
As in the case of segmentation, besides containing the physical frame
number, each page table entry also usually contains a valid bit, and some
protection bits.  Some more bits are present to aid demaind paging (to be
studied later).
<p>
The page table for the current process is usually stored in the main memory
itself.  A special register is used to indicate the (physical) address of the
page table.
<p>
The main problem with paging is the amount of memory needed to maintain the
page tables.  For a typical processor with 32 bit addresses, 4K page size and
4 byte page table entries, the page table for a process would occupy 4MB of
memory!  For most processes, this amount may actually be more than the memory
requirement of the process.  Thus a lot of memory is being wasted just to keep
track of the invalid pages.  The size of the page table can be reduced by
increasing the page size but that would increase the amount of internal
fragmentation.

<h4>
Multilevel paging
</h4>
The problems of huge page tables can be solved using <i>multi-level</i> or 
<i>hierarchical</i> paging. Commonly a two level paging scheme is employed. 
Here a virtual address is split into three fields as follows.  The most
significant <i>m</i> bits in the address determine the index into the first
level page table (also called the page directory).  The entry in the first
level page table gives the physical address of the second level page table.
The next <i>n</i> bits in the address are used as index into this second level
page table.  The entry in the second level page table gives the physical frame
number.  Address translation in a two level paging scheme is illustrated in
the figure below.

<p align="center"><i>Address translation in a two level paging scheme.</i></p>

<p>
Valid bit and protection bits are usually present in both the first level and 
second level page table entries.
Note that the two level paging scheme is simlar to segmentation except that
instead of storing segments contiguously in physical memory, the segments are
paged; thus there is a page table (the second level page table) for each
segment.  The two level paging scheme reduces the overall size of page tables
for small processes since the second level page table need not exist if the
valid bit in the corresponding first level page table entry indicates the
entire region to be invalid.  Thus large regions of the virtual address space
can be invalidated with very little overhead.
<p>
Another advantage of two level paging is that processes that share entire
segments can share the page table for the segment as well.  This also reduces
the memory requirements.

<h4>
The Translation Look-Aside Buffer (TLB)
</h4>
Since page tables are usually stored in the main memory itself, each memory
requires extra memory accesses for translating the virtual address to physical
address.  In a two level paging scheme, two extra memory accesses are required
for accessing the page tables at the two levels.  This means that the
effective memory access speed is reduced by a factor of 3.  To speed up the
translation, the hardware generally uses a fast cache to store the recently
used translations.  This cache is called the Translation Look-Aside Buffer
(TLB). With the TLB, the page tables in main memory are accessed only when
there is a TLB miss; this can significantly reduce the cost of address
translation.  The TLB and its operation are completely transparent to the
software.  However, note that the TLB needs to be flushed or invalidated when
a context switch is made.  The CPU usually provides special instructions to
perform these operations.

<h4>
Software Managed TLBs
</h4>
In this scheme the hardware is only aware of the TLB for its address 
translation, i.e., given a virtual  address the hardware
looks into the TLB. If the required translation entry is not found, 
an exception is raised.  The operating system handles the exception,
and if the page is valid, it inserts the required entry into the TLB (possibly
evicting some other entry), and returns from the exception handler.  When the
CPU retries translating the address, the required translation entry is found
in the TLB and the execution proceeds as usual.  Thus the TLB miss cost is
higher but the hardware is simpler.
