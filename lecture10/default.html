<h4>
Unnamed Pipes</h4>
Pipes are a commonly used IPC mechanism in Unix.  Pipes can be
named or unnamed.  Unnamed pipes are very commonly used, for example,
in shell commands that `pipe' the output of one program as input to
another program.
<p>
Access to unnamed pipes can be passed on to its children by the
process that creates the pipes.  There is no other way to obtain
access to an existing unnamed pipe.  Thus, unnamed pipes can only
be used for communication by `related' processes.  For example,
the processes could have a parent-child, or a sibling relationship.
<p>
The kernel associates a fixed size FIFO buffer with every pipe that
is created.  Message boundaries are not preserved in this buffer, i.e.,
the buffer is a queue of bytes rather than a queue of messages.
There can, in general, be multiple readers and/or multiple writers
for the same pipe.  The data written by writers is queued up in a
FIFO manner.  Any reader always extracts some bytes from the front
of the buffer.  Thus two readers will never get the same data.
<p>
Read calls to a pipe block till some data is available in the buffer.
Note that a read request for <i>n</i> bytes will return as soon as
even one byte is available, the return value of the read call indicates
the actual number of bytes read. 
Write calls only block if the buffer is full.
<p>
An unnamed pipe is created using the <i>pipe</i> system call.
The argument is (a pointer to) an array a of at least 2 integers.
If the pipe creation is successful, on return, a[0] will contain
a file descriptor for reading the pipe, and a[1] will contain a
file descriptor for writing to the pipe.  The return value of the
pipe call is 0 or -1 depending on whether the pipe creation was
successful or not.
<p>
Pipes are read from and written to using the usual read and write
calls used for reading from and writing to files respectively.
Here is an example code snippet that illustrates how a parent and
child process can communicate using an unnamed pipe.  Note that
the parent must first create the pipe and then fork the child process
so that the child inherits access to the pipe file descriptors.
<pre>
    int r, fd[2], cpid;
    r = pipe(fd);
    if (r == -1) {
        ...error...
    }
    switch (cpid = fork()) {
        case -1:
            ...error...
        case 0:  /* child */
            close(fd[0]); 
            /* child does not wish to read from pipe,
               so it closes the file descriptor for reading the pipe
            */
            r = write(fd[1], buffer, n);
            ....
        default: /* parent */
            close(fd[1]);
            r = read(fd[0], buffer, n);
            ....
    }
    ....

<h4>
I/O Redirection in UNIX</h4>

Let us see how transparent I/O redirection is implemented by a shell
program in Unix.  When a command such as `ls -l | more' is given by
a user to the shell, the shell creates two child processes, one to
execute the ls program, and the other to execute the more program.
But before it uses the execve call in the two processes, it executes
some code in both processes to ensure that the standard output of the
process which will execute ls is connected via a pipe to the standard
input of the process which will execute more.  Note that both the
ls and more programs need not be aware, in general, of this redirection;
they just write to standard output and read from standard input
respectively.
<p>
To understand how I/O redirection works, we need to understand a bit
about file related data structures maintained by Unix.  We shall see
details of these data structures later when we study file systems.
<p>
For each process, Unix maintains an ``open file descriptor table''.
The file descriptors returned by open, pipe, etc., system calls are
just indices into this table.  Corresponding to each valid file
descriptor for the process, the file descriptor table entry contains
a pointer to some kernel data structure which gives information about
what file does this file descriptor represent, what mode is the file
open in (read, write etc), etc.  During fork, the file descriptor table
created for the child is a copy of the parent's file descriptor table.
This is how the child inherits access to files etc., open in the parent
process at the time of fork.
<p>
File descriptors 0, 1, 2 (by convention) always refer to the standard
input, standard output, and standard error streams respectively.  These
file descriptors are opened by the getty program and are therefore
available to all processes.  Usually all these file descriptors refer
to the terminal in which the process is running.
<p>
The <i>dup</i> call can be used by a process to duplicate some valid
file descriptor to the <i>first unused entry in its open file descriptor
table</i>.  This call is the key to implementing I/O redirection.
To ensure that the standard output of a process refers to a given
file descriptor (which could be for a file, pipe etc.), the process
just needs to close file descriptor 1, and then <i>dup</i> the 
file descriptor of interest.  Since fd 1 is the first unused fd, 
it becomes a duplicate of the specified fd (which can now be closed).
Similarly the standard input or standard error streams of a process
can be redirected to files, pipes etc.
Note that this manipulation of file descriptors is performed by the
shell program in the child process(es) <i>before</i> calling execve.
<p>
Here is an example of how the shell program might carry out the
command ``ls -l | more''.
<pre>
    int cpid1, cpid2, r, fd[2];
    r = pipe(fd);
    if (r == -1) {
        ...error...
    }
    switch ((cpid1 = fork()) {
        case -1: ... error...
        case 0: /* child process, will execute ls */
            close(fd[0]); /* will not read from pipe */
            close(1); /* to dup fd[1] into fd 1 */
            dup(fd[1]); /* now fd 1 can also be used to write to pipe */
            close(fd[1]); /* no need for the other copy of the pipe fd */
            execve("/bin/ls", ...);
        default:;
    }
    switch ((cpid2 = fork()) {
        case -1: ... error...
        case 0: /* child process, will execute more */
            close(fd[1]); /* will not write to pipe */
            close(0); /* to dup fd[0] into fd 0 */
            dup(fd[0]); /* now fd 0 can also be used to read from pipe */
            close(fd[0]); /* no need for the other copy of the pipe fd */
            execve("/usr/bin/more", ...);
        default:;
    }
    /* only parent (shell) will execute this */
    close(fd[0]);
    close(fd[1]); /* parent will neither write to nor read from pipe */
    /* but the descriptors must be closed <i>after</i> the children are created */
    wait(...);
