<h3>About this lecture</h3>

In this lecture, we will study the synchronization primitives supported
by Java and by PThreads.  We illustrate the available facilities in both
using the classical producer-consumer problem.

<h3>Java Thread Synchronization</h3>

All the Java objects have a unique entry lock associated with it. But a usual 
object does not behave as a monitor, since the lock is not acquired while 
calling by the object methods. 
<p>
In the Java language, a critical section can be a block or a method and can be 
easily identified using the <code>synchronized</code> keyword. The Java 
platform ensures that any thread acquires a lock before entering such a 
critical section.
<p>
As an example, consider a skeleton Java class defined as follows.

<blockquote><pre>
    public class C
    {
      ... 
      ... (Other functions /declarations)
      ...

      public synchronized void f()
      {
         ...
      }

      private synchronized int g()
      {
         ...
      }
    }          
</pre></blockquote>

Note that both the method declarations for <code>f</code> and 
<code>g</code> contain the <code>synchronized</code> keyword. Hence, 
whenever the control enters these synchronized methods, the thread that 
called the method locks the object whose method has been called. 
Other threads cannot call any synchronized method on the same object until the 
object is unlocked. To be more precise, two <code>synchronized</code> 
functions can not be called concurrently on the same object. Please note 
that each object has a distinct entry lock associated to it; two distinct
objects have their own locks even if they belong to the same class. 

<p>

Every object is also associated with a single unnamed condition variable. 
Methods <code>wait</code>, <code>notify</code>, and <code>notifyAll </code> 
(implemented in the <code>Object</code> class) can be called on this unnamed 
condition variable. The function prototypes are: 

<blockquote><pre>
    public final void <b>wait</b>()
                     throws InterruptedException
    
    public final void <b>notify</b>()

    public final void <b>notifyAll</b>()
</pre></blockquote>

Note that all these three functions also throw 
<code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code>. We will discuss what it means 
shortly.  
<p>
When <code>this.wait()</code> is called, the calling thread waits
on the unnamed condition variable of the current object (<code>this</code>). 
The thread goes to sleep, after leaving the lock atomically 
(we already discussed why these instructions must be executed atomically. 
To repeat, we do not want to lose any notify calls during the time-period 
between the release of lock and going to sleep) and waits until another thread 
notifies the threads waiting on this object's condition variable to wake up 
either through a call to the <code>notify</code> method or the 
<code>notifyAll</code> method. The thread then waits until it can re-obtain 
ownership of the lock and resumes execution.  

<p>
It is trivial to notice that the calling thread must hold the entry lock, 
to be able to call the <code>wait()</code> method. Thus the method should only 
be called from a synchronized function or from some function which was called 
directly or indirectly from some synchronized function. The basic idea is that 
the thread must hold the entry lock of the object, to be able to call this 
function. The function throws <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> in 
case the current thread is not the owner of the object's entry lock.
A thread can become the owner of the object lock in one of the 
following three ways:

<ul>
<li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object. 
<li>By executing the body of a <code>synchronized</code> statement that 
synchronizes on the object. 
<li>For objects of type <code>Class</code>, by executing a synchronized 
static method of that class. 
</ul>

Note that as the <code>wait</code> method  places the current thread into the 
wait queue for this object, it unlocks only this object; any other objects on 
which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread 
waits. 
<p>
Following variants of the <code>wait</code> method are available: 
<code>wait(long timeout)</code> and <code>wait(long timeout, int nanos)</code>.
These methods can be used to specify a timeout after which the method 
returns (after re-acquiring the lock, as usual) even after the thread has
not been notified. Please consult the Java API for more details. 
<p>
The <code>notify</code> method wakes up a single thread that is waiting on 
this object's condition variable. If any threads are waiting on this object, 
one of them is woken up. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at the discretion 
of the implementation. This method also throws 
<code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> if the current thread is not the 
owner of this object's entry lock. 
<p>
The <code>notifyAll</code> method performs the same function as 
<code>notify</code>, except that it wakes up all the threads that are waiting 
on this object's condition variable. 

<h4>Example: Implementation of Producer-Consumer Problem in Java</h4>
Here is a possible implementation for the producer-consumer problem
in Java.

<blockquote><pre>
   public class BoundedBuffer
   {
      private static int N=100;
      private Item buffer[N];
      private int in = 0 , out = 0, size = 0;
      
      public synchronized void add(Item i)
      {
         while(size==N)
	   try{
	      wait();
	   }
	   catch(InterruptedException e)
	   {
	      System.out.println(e);
	   }
	 buffer[in]=i;
	 in=(in+1)%N;
	 size++;
	 notify(); // notify a consumer
      }

      public synchronized Item consume()
      {  
         Item i;
         while(size==0)
	   try{
	      wait();
	   }
	   catch(InterruptedException e)
	   {
	      System.out.println(e);
	   }
	 i=buffer[out];
	 out=(out+1)%N;
	 size--;
	 notify(); // notify a producer
	 return i;
      }
   }
</pre></blockquote>

Note that in this solution, both producers and consumers wait on the
same condition variable (the condition variable of the 
<code>BoundedBuffer</code> object).
However, we do not need to use <code>notifyAll()</code> instead of 
<code>notify()</code>, since both producers and consumers cannot be
sleeping at the same time. Thus, a producer will only wake up a
consumer (not another producer), and a consumer will only wake up
a producer (not another consumer).  In general, however, a different condition
variable should be used for each logically distinct event in order
to unnecessarily wake up more threads than necessary. 
To avoid this, we need to use multiple Java objects since each Java object
is necessarily associated with exactly one condition variable.  
<a href="lecture19_code1.html">Here</a> is another Java solution to the
producer-consumer problem where producers and consumers wait on
different condition variables.

<h3>POSIX Thread API</h3>

The POSIX library provides support for both mutexes and condition variables. 
The functions associated with these primitives are explained below.
<h4>Mutex</h4>
A mutex is a binary semaphore, having two possible states: unlocked 
(not owned by any thread), and locked (owned by one thread). A mutex can never 
be owned by two different threads simultaneously. A thread attempting to lock 
a mutex that is already locked by another thread is suspended until the owning 
thread unlocks the mutex. 
<blockquote><pre>
     <b>pthread_mutex_t</b> mutex;
     int  <b>pthread_mutex_init</b>(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutex_attr_t *mutexattr);
     int  <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int  <b>pthread_mutex_trylock</b>(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int  <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int  <b>pthread_mutex_destroy</b>(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
</pre></blockquote>
The first statement above illustrates the declaration of a mutex.
<code>pthread_mutex_init</code> initializes the mutex object pointed to 
by <code>mutex</code> according to the attributes specified in 
<code>mutexattr</code>. If <code>mutexattr</code> is <code>NULL</code>, 
default attributes are used instead.
<p>The Linux PThread implementation supports only one mutex attribute, the 
mutex kind, which is either `fast', `recursive' or `error checking'. The kind 
determines whether it can be locked again by the thread that already owns it. 
The default kind is `fast'.  Consult the manual page of 
<code>pthread_mutexattr_init</code> for more information on mutex attributes.  

<p><code>pthread_mutex_lock</code> locks the given mutex. In case the mutex is 
currently locked by another thread, the method suspends the calling thread 
until the mutex is unlocked. Else, if the mutex is currently unlocked, it is 
locked and owned by the calling thread, and <code>pthread_mutex_lock</code> 
returns immediately.

<p><code>pthread_mutex_trylock</code> behaves identically to 
<code>pthread_mutex_lock</code>, except that it does not block the calling 
thread if the mutex is already locked, instead, it returns immediately with 
the error code <code>EBUSY</code>.

<p><code>pthread_mutex_unlock</code> unlocks the given mutex. The mutex is 
assumed to be locked and owned by the calling thread on entrance to 
<code>pthread_mutex_unlock</code>. 

<p><code>pthread_mutex_destroy</code> destroys a mutex object, freeing the 
resources it might hold. The mutex must be unblocked on entrance. 

<p>
<h4>Condition Variables</h4>
This synchronization device allows threads to suspend execution and relinquish 
the processors until some predicate on shared data is satisfied.
<blockquote><pre>
       <b>pthread_cond_t</b> cond;
       int <b>pthread_cond_init</b>(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_condattr_t *cond_attr);
       int <b>pthread_cond_wait</b>(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex);       
       int <b>pthread_cond_signal</b>(pthread_cond_t *cond);
       int <b>pthread_cond_broadcast</b>(pthread_cond_t *cond);
       int <b>pthread_cond_timedwait</b>(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const struct timespec *abstime);
       int <b>pthread_cond_destroy</b>(pthread_cond_t *cond);
</pre></blockquote>
The first statement declares a condition variable. 
<code>pthread_cond_init</code> initializes the condition variable 
<code>cond</code> using the condition attributes specified in 
<code>code_attr</code>, or default in case <code>cond_attr</code> is 
<code>NULL</code>. 

<p><code>pthread_cond_wait</code> atomically unlocks the mutex 
and waits for the condition variable <code>cond</code> to be signaled. The 
thread execution is suspended and does not consume any CPU time until the 
condition variable is signaled. The <code>mutex</code> must be locked by the 
calling thread. Before returning to the calling thread, 
<code>pthread_cond_wait</code> re-acquires <code>mutex</code>. The
<code>mutex</code> is required as an argument, since release of the 
<code>mutex</code> and going to sleep must happen atomically. 

<p><code>pthread_cond_signal</code> restarts one of the threads that were 
waiting on the condition variable <code>cond</code>. If no threads are 
waiting on <code>cond</code>, nothing happens. If several threads are waiting 
on <code>cond</code>, exactly one is restarted, but it is not specified which 
one. It must be noted that, the thread woken is not scheduled instantly, 
instead, it is made ready, and gets scheduled later according to the 
scheduling policy. 

<p><code>pthread_cond_broadcast</code> restarts all the threads which were 
waiting on the condition variable <code>cond</code>.

<p><b>Example: Implementation of Producer-Consumer problem</b>
<p>
We illustrate the PThread synchronization primitives using the familiar
producer-consumer problem.
<blockquote><pre>
   #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
   #define N 100   

   class BoundedBuffer
   {
      Item buffer[N];
      int in, out, size;
      pthread_mutex_t mutex;
      pthread_cond_t not_full, not_empty;

      BoundedBuffer()
      {
         in=out=size=0;
         pthread_mutex_init(&amp;mutex,NULL);
	 pthread_cond_init(&amp;not_full,NULL);
	 pthread_cond_init(&amp;not_empty,NULL);
      }

      void add(Item i)
      {
         pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);
         while(size==N)
	    pthread_cond_wait(&amp;not_full, &amp;mutex);
	 buffer[in]=i;
	 in=(in+1)%N;
	 size++;
	 pthread_cond_signal(&amp;not_empty);
	 pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);
      }

      int consume()
      {
         pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mutex);
	 while(size==0)
	    pthread_cond_wait(&amp;not_empty, &amp;mutex);
	 int i=buffer[out];
	 out=(out+1)%N;
	 size--;
	 pthread_cond_signal(&amp;not_full);
	 pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mutex);
      }
   };
